078/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Whereof do they question one another?): He says: what are they-meaning the people of Quraysh-talking about?
078/002:((It is) of the awful tidings) they are talking about the tidings of the noble, glorious and great Quran,
078/003:(Concerning which they are in disagreement) some of them disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Quran while others believe in them. This is because whenever Gabriel brought down a section of the Quran to the Prophet (pbuh) and he recited it to them, they used to talk about it, and some of them would believe while others would persist in their disbelief.
078/004:(Nay) this is a reply to the disbelievers, (but they will come to know!) They will come to know upon the advent of death what will be done with them.
078/005:(Nay) truly, (again, but they will come to know!) They will come to know in the grave what will be done with them. This is a threat from Allah to those who disbelieved in Muhammad (pbuh) and in the Quran.
078/006:Allah then mentioned the blessings He bestowed upon them, saying: (Have We not made the earth an expanse) and a place to sleep,
078/007:(And the high hills bulwarks) for it so that it does not sway?

078/012:(And We have built) and We have created (above you) above your heads (seven strong (heavens)) seven thick heavens,
078/013:(And have appointed a dazzling lamp) and have appointed a radiant sun for the children of Adam,
078/014:(And have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant Water,
078/015:Thereby to produce grain and plant) to produce through the rain all kinds of grains and plants,
078/016:(And gardens of thick foliage) and it is also said this means: different kinds of foliage.
078/017:(Lo! the Day of Decision is a fixed time) it is the appointed time when the people of old and later generations will be gathered,
078/018:(A day when the trumpet is blown) the blowing of the resurrection, (and ye come in multitudes) host after host and group after group,
078/019:(And the heaven is opened) and the gates of heaven are opened (and becometh as gates) and becomes different roads,
078/020:(And the hills are set in motion) on the face of the earth (and become as a mirage.
078/021:Lo! Hell lurketh in ambush) the Fire is a detention and prison,
078/022:(A home for the rebellious) a point of return for the disbelievers.
078/023:(They will abide therein for ages) they will abide in the Fire for ages and ages, each age consisting of 80 years, each year being 360 days and each day is the equivalent of 1,000 years of the years of the life of the world; it is also said that none knows the exact duration of these ages save Allah, and therefore these ages are never interrupted.
078/024:(Therein) in the Fire (taste they neither coolness) cool water; and it is also said this means: sleep (nor (any) drink) cold drink
078/025:(Save boiling water and a paralysing cold) and it is also said this means: filthy water:
078/026:(Reward proportioned (to their evil deeds)) a reward which is commensurate with their works.
078/027:(For lo! they looked not) while in the life of the world (for a reckoning) they did not fear the chastisement of the Hereafter nor did they believe in it;
078/028:(They called Our revelations) Our Scripture and Messenger (false with strong denial.
078/029:Everything) regarding the works of the children of Adam (have We recorded in a Book) We wrote it down in the Guarded or Preserved Tablet.
078/030:(So taste) the chastisement in the Fire. (No increase do We give you) in the Fire (save of torment) one kind of torment after another.
078/031:(Lo! for the duteous) for those who ward off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies (is achievement) safety from the Fire and nearness of Allah
078/032:(Gardens) of trees and palm-trees (enclosed and vineyards,
078/033:And maidens for companions) who are all of the same age: 33 years of age,
078/034:(And a full cup) one cup after another.
078/035:(There) in Paradise (hear they) the inhabitants of the Garden (never vain discourse) oaths or falsehood, (nor lying) they do not lie to each other.
078/036:(Requital) a reward (from thy Lord a gift) that He bestows upon them in the Garden (in payment) ten rewards for each good deed; and it is also said this means: reward in proportion to their good deeds
078/037:(Lord of the heavens and the earth, and (all) that is between them) of creation and marvels, (the Beneficent) He is the Beneficent; (with Whom none) none of His slaves, i.e. the angels as well as others (can converse) with regard to intercession until Allah gives them permission to do so.
078/038:(On the day when the angels and the Spirit) Gabriel; and it is also said: this is a created being whose tremendousness only Allah knows; Ibn Masud also said: the Spirit is an angel greater than every thing save the Throne, and this angel glorifies Allah each day 12,000 formulas of glorification, and which each glorification he utters Allah creates an angel who seeks forgiveness for the believers until the Day of Judgement; it is also said this refers to a group of angels who have feet and hands like those of humans (stand arrayed, they speak not) to intercede, (saving him whom the Beneficent alloweth) to intercede (and who speaketh right) truly "there is no deity save Allah".
078/039:(That is the True Day) in which will happen what I have mentioned. (So whoso will should seek recourse) whoever will believe in Allahs divine Oneness and seek through his belief in Allahs divine Oneness a way of return (unto his Lord.
078/040:(Lo! We warn you) people of Mecca (of a doom at hand) which will surely happen, (a day whereon a man will look) when the believer will look; and it is also said: when the disbeliever will look (on that which his own hands have sent before) have earned of good or evil, (and the disbeliever will cry: "Would that I were dust!") with the beasts. Because of the horrors, severity and torment of that day, the disbeliever will wish to be turned into dust along with beasts. This will occur on the day when the first trumpet resounds'. 
079/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allahs saying (By those who drag forth): (By those who drag forth) He says: Allah swears by the angels who take away the souls of the disbelievers (to destruction) the souls of the disbelievers,
079/002:(By the meteors rushing) and it is also said that He is here swearing by the angels who busy the disbelievers with grief and anxiety; it is also said that this refers to the souls of the believers which hasten to come out of their bodies in order to go to the Garden.
079/003:(By the lone stars floating) and it is also said that He is here swearing by the angels who take away the souls of the righteous slowly and gently and then let them rest; it is also said this refers to the souls of the believers,
079/004:(By the angels hastening) and He swears by the angels who hasten to Paradise with the souls of the believers and to the Fire with the souls of the disbelievers; it is also said this refers to the souls of the believers that hasten to Paradise,
079/005:(And those who govern the event) and He swears by the angels who govern the matters of the slaves, meaning Gabriel, Michael, Seraphiel and the angel of death. It is said that (those who govern the event) refers to the spears of soldiers, (the meteors rushing) refers to the ropes of soldiers and (the lone stars floating) refers to the ships of soldiers who fight at sea, (the ones who do the hastening) refers to the horses of soldiers, while (those who govern the event) refers to the generals of soldiers; it is also said that (the lone stars floating) refer to the sun, the moon, the day and the night. Allah swore by all these that the two blowings of the trumpet will take place, with an interval of 40 years separating the two blowings.
079/006:So Allah said: (On the day when the first trump resoundeth) this refers to the first blowing of the trumpet when everything will quake.
079/007:(And the second followeth it) this is the final blowing on the trumpet,
079/008:(On that day) which is the Day of Judgement (hearts beat painfully) the hearts are fearful
079/009:(While eyes are downcast) abased
079/010:((Now) they) the disbelievers of Mecca: al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his host (are saying: Shall we really be restored to our first state) to the life of the world; and it is also said: from the graves
079/011:(Even after we are crumbled bones?) Will Allah resurrect us? How is this possible?
079/012:The Prophet (pbuh) said to them: "Indeed, Allah will raise you again from the dead". (They say: Then that would be a vain proceeding) that would be a failed attempt, because it will never happen.
079/013:And so Allah said: (Surely it will need but one shout) one blow which does not require a second one, and this is the blow of the resurrection,
079/014:(And lo! they will be awakened) on the face of the earth; and it is also said: in the land of the gathering.
079/015:(Hath there come unto thee) O Muhammad (the history of Moses) the story of Moses? Meaning: the story of Moses has already come to you; and it is also said this means: the story of Moses has not yet come to you.
079/016:(How his Lord called him in the holy vale of Tuwa) the name of the valley; it was called so because it was traversed by so many prophets; it is also said: tread (Ta), O Moses, with your feet on this valley because of its goodness and grace.
079/017:((Saying:) Go thou) O Moses (unto Pharaoh. Lo! he hath rebelled) he is arrogant and too proud and has refused to believe in Allah
079/018:(And say (unto him): Hast thou) O Pharaoh ((will) to grow (in grace)) will become righteous, surrender and believe in Allahs divine Oneness?
079/019:(Then I will guide thee) I will call you (to thy Lord and thou shalt fear (Him)) and therefore surrender to Him.
079/020:(And he) Moses (showed him the tremendous token) the hand and the staff.
079/021:(But be denied) and said: this is not from Allah (and disobeyed) he refused the message,
079/022:(Then turned he away) from faith; and it is also said: from Moses (in haste) to his folk; and it is also said: to think what to do about Moses,
079/023:(Then gathered he) his army (and summoned) and delivered a sermon
079/024:(And proclaimed: "I (Pharaoh) am your Lord the Highest".) I am your Highest Lord and the Lord of your idols, therefore, do not leave the worship of these idols.
079/025:(So Allah seized him) Allah punished him ((and made him) an example for the after (life) and for the former) the punishment that he suffered in the life of the world is drowning and the punishment of the Hereafter will be in the Fire; it is also said that this means: Allah has punished him because of his former and latter pronouncements. His first pronouncement being: "I do not know of any other god for you except Me" and the second being (I am your Lord the Highest) and it is said that there is an interval of 40 years between the first and second pronouncements.
079/026:(Lo! Herein) in that which We did to Pharaoh and his host (is indeed a lesson) an admonition (for him who feareth) that which has been done to them.
079/027:(Are ye) O people of Mecca (the harder to create) harder to resurrect and more perfect in your creation, (or is the heaven that He built?
079/028:He raised the height) its ceiling (thereof and ordered it) above the earth;
079/029:(And He made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morn thereof) and He made its day and sun clear.
079/030:(And after that He spread the earth) even then He spread it on the water; it is also said: 2,000 years after that He spread it on the water,
079/031:(And produced therefrom) from the earth (the water thereof) running water as well as the water buried deep in the belly of the earth (and the pasture thereof,
079/032:And He made fast the hills) and He made the mountains firm,
079/033:(A provision for you) water of benefit to you (and for your cattle) water and pasture benefit your cattle.
079/034:(But when the great disaster cometh) but when the Hour comes, it will tower above everything and nothing will escape it,
079/035:(The day when man will call to mind) when the disbeliever, al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith and his host, will remember and know (his (whole) endeavour) the works he did in his state of disbelief,
079/036:(And hell will stand forth visible to him who seeth) to him who is ordained to enter it,
079/037:(Then, as for him who rebelled) him who was too arrogant and proud and disbelieved in Allah, i.e. al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith Ibn Alqamah
079/038:(And chose the life of the world) rather than the Hereafter and also chose disbelief rather than faith,
079/039:(Lo! Hell will be his home) the Fire is the home of him who is thus.
079/040:(But as for him who feared) upon committing a sin (to stand before his Lord) his standing before his Lord and abstains from engaging in sin (and restrained his soul from lust) from that which is unlawful, even though he desires it, this refers to Musab Ibn Umayr.
079/041:(Lo! the Garden will be his home) Paradise will be the home of him who is thus.
079/042:(They ask thee) the disbelievers of Mecca ask you, O Muhammad, (of the Hour) about the advent of the Hour: (when will it come to port?) When is it going to happen? Because they disbelieved in it.
079/043:(Why (ask they)? What hast thou to tell thereof?) What has it to do with you that you should mention it to them?
079/044:(Unto thy Lord belongeth (knowledge of) the term thereof) the knowledge of its timing belongs to Allah.
079/045:(Thou art but a warner) you are but a warning messenger by means of the Quran (unto him who feareth it) to him who fears its advent.
079/046:(On the day when they behold it) i.e. the Hour, (it will be as if they had but tarried) in the graves (for an evening) the duration of an evening (or the morn thereof) or the duration of one morning'. 
080/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (He frowned): (He frowned) He says: Muhammad (pbuh) showed a stern face (and turned away) his face
080/002:(Because the blind man came unto him) when Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum came to him. His real name is Abdullah Ibn Shurayh. Umm Maktum was his fathers mother. What happened is that the Prophet (pbuh) was sitting with a group of men among the nobles of Quraysh, among whom were his uncle al-Abbas Ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf al-Jumahi and Safwan Ibn Umayyah, who were at that time disbelievers. The Prophet (pbuh) was admonishing and inviting them to Islam when Ibn Maktum came to him and said: "O Messenger of Allah! Teach me of that which Allah has taught you". The Prophet (pbuh) turned his face from him because he was busy with these people. When this happened Allah revealed: he frowned and turned away because the blind man came unto him.
080/003:(What could inform thee) O Muhammad (but that he might) i.e. the blind man (grow (in grace)) became righteous through the admonitions of the Quran
080/004:(Or take heed) by means of the Quran (and so the reminder) by means of the Quran (might avail him?) It is also said that this means: how do you know O Muhammad, whether or not he becomes righteous and whether or not he benefits from the admonitions of the Quran.
080/005:(As for him who thinketh himself independent) of Allah, i.e. the three men mentioned above,
080/006:(Unto him thou payest regard) you turn your face to them.
080/007:(Yet it is not thy concern if he grow not (in grace)) it is not your concern if these three men do not believe in Allahs divine Oneness.
080/008:(But as for him who cometh unto thee with earnest purpose) hastening for goodness
080/009:(And hath fear) of Allah, and is also a Muslim; this is because Ibn Umm Maktum had accepted Islam before this incident,
080/010:(From him thou) O Muhammad (art distracted) being busy with those three men.
080/011:(Nay) do not do this; He says: do not turn to those who think themselves independent of Allah and turn away from he who fears Allah. After this reminder, the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour Ibn Umm Maktum and treat him well, (but verily it) this surah (is an Admonishment) from Allah both for the rich and the poor,
080/012:(So let whosoever will pay heed to it) whoever Allah wants him to be admonished will be admonished,
080/013:(On honoured leaves) He says: the Quran is written on scrolls made of skin which are honoured in the sight of Allah
080/014:(Exalted) in heaven, (purified) from filth and idolatry,
080/015:((Set down) by scribes) written by scribes
080/016:(Noble) in the sight of Allah and surrendered to Him (and righteous) truthful; these are the keepers of the nether heaven.
080/017:(Man is (self)-destroyed) the disbeliever, i.e. Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab, is cursed: (how ungrateful!) what has made him a disbelieve in Allah and in the stars of the Quran, i.e. in the star when it sets; it is also said that this means: how extreme is his disbelief.
080/018:(From what thing doth He create him?) He says: let him think about his own person: from what did He create him as a living being?
080/019:Allah then explained and said to him: (From a drop of seed. He createth him) a living being (and proportioneth him) He proportioned his creation by giving him two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ears as well as all the other organs,
080/020:(Then maketh the way easy for him) He made clear to him the way of good and the way of evil; and it is also said this means: He made easy for him to come out of the way of the womb,
080/021:(Then causeth him to die) after this, (and burieth him) and commanded to bury him;
080/022:(Then, when He will, He bringeth him again to life) i.e. He will resurrect him from the grave.
080/023:(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but (man) hath not done what He commanded him) of profession of Allahs divine Oneness and other things.
080/024:(Let man consider his food) let the disbelieving person, Utbah Ibn Abi Lahab, think about the food he eats, how it is transformed from state to state until it reaches him to eat:
080/025:Allah then explained these different states, saying: (How We pour water) i.e. rain (in showers) upon the earth
080/026:(Then split the earth in clefts) through plants
080/027:(And cause the grain) all kinds of grain (to grow therein) in the earth
080/028:(And grapes and green fodder
080/029:And olive trees and palm-trees
080/030:And garden closes of thick foliage
080/031:And fruits) different kinds of fruit (and grasses) and fodder; and it also said this means: straw:
080/032:(Provision for you) the grains are of benefit to you (and your cattle) and fodder is of benefit to your cattle.
080/033:(But when the Shout cometh) when the Hour comes, all created beings will scream and then submit and answer the call. Created being will be abased and know then that its advent is true.
080/034:Allah then explained when this will happen, saying: (On the day when a man) the believer (fleeth from his brother) who is a disbeliever
080/035:(And his mother) and will also flee from his mother (and his father
080/036:And his wife and his children) it is also said this means: when Abel will flee from Cain, and Muhammad (pbuh) will flee from his mother Aminah, and Abraham from his father, and Lot from his wife Wailah and Nuh from his son Canaan.
080/037:(Every man that day) on the Day of Judgement (will have concern enough to make him heedless (of others)) to keep him preoccupied from others.
080/038:(On that day faces) the faces of the believers who are true in their faith (will be bright as dawn) will be blooming due to Allahs pleasure with them,
080/039:(Laughing) pleased with Allahs bestowal of honour upon them, (rejoicing at good news) happy with Allahs reward;
080/040:(And other faces) the faces of the hypocrites and disbelievers, (on that day) on the Day of Judgement, (with dust upon them,
080/041:Veiled in darkness) gloomy and dark,
080/042:(Those) with such a trait (are the disbelievers) in Allah, (the wicked) the liars against Allah'.
081/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (When the sun is overthrown): (When the sun is overthrown) it is also said that He says: when the sun is turned around as one turns a turban and is then thrown into the veil of light; it is also said this means: when the light of the sun vanishes.
081/002:(And when the stars fall) on the face of the earth,
081/003:(And when the hills are moved) from above the surface of the earth
081/004:(And when the camels big with young are abandoned) because they are preoccupied with their own selves,
081/005:(And when the wild beasts are herded together) for retaliation; and it is also said this means: when they are dead,
081/006:(And when the seas rise) and mix with each other, the sweet seas and the salty seas, such that they become one sea; and it is also said this means: when they become a burning site,
081/007:(And when souls are reunited) in pairs; it is also said this means: when souls are reunited with their companions: the believer with the maiden of Paradise and the disbeliever with Satan; the righteous with the righteous and the sinful with the sinful,
081/008:(And when the girl child that was buried alive is asked) i.e. when she asks her father
081/009:(For what sin she was slain) for what sin did you kill me; it is also said that this means: when the one who killed her is asked: for what sin did you kill her,
081/010:(And when the pages) the registers of good and bad deeds (are laid open) for reckoning; it is also said this means: when they fly about in peoples hands,
081/011:(And when the sky is torn away,
081/012:And when hell is lighted) for the disbelievers
081/013:(And when the Garden is brought nigh) for the believers
081/014:((Then) every soul will know) every soul whether it is righteous or sinful will know at that point (what it hath made ready) what it has sent forth of good or evil.
081/015:(Oh, but I call to witness) He says: I swear by (the planets) which appear at night and disappear during the day,
081/016:(The stars which rise and set) they move at night in the galaxy sweeping away the day and then go back to their positions and disappear; the reference here is to five planets: Venus, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury;
081/017:(And the close of night,
081/018:And the breath of morning) and when the morning and brightens come; Allah swore by all these
081/019:(That this) i.e. the Quran (is in truth the word of an honoured messenger) Allah says: it is brought down by Gabriel to a messenger who is honoured by Allah, i.e. Muhammad (pbuh)
081/020:(Mighty) against his enemies, i.e. Gabriel, (established in the presence of the Lord of the Throne) he has standing and esteem with his Lord,
081/021:((One) to be obeyed) i.e. Gabriel is obeyed in Heaven: the angels obey him, (and trustworthy) in conveying the message to the prophets;
081/022:(And your comrade) your Prophet Muhammad, O Quraysh (is not mad) bewitched as you claim.
081/023:(Surely he beheld him) Muhammad saw Gabriel (on the clear horizon) on the high setting of the sun.
081/024:(And he is not) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (avid of the Unseen) he is accused with regard to the revelation; and it is also said this means: he is not avaricious.
081/025:(Nor is this) i.e. the Quran (the utterance of a devil worthy to be stoned) the utterance of an accursed, rebellious devil whose name is al-Marmi.
081/026:(Whither then go ye) from Allahs chastisement, commands and prohibitions, O disbelievers? It is also said this means: why do you lie? And it is also said this means: why do you deviate from the Quran and refuse to believe in it?
081/027:(This is) i.e. the Quran (naught else than a reminder) an admonition from Allah (unto creation) the jinn and humankind,
081/028:(Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight) to whoever wills to conform to the commands of Allah: the belief in Allahs divine Oneness and other things.
081/029:(And ye will not) conform with or believe in Allah's divine Oneness, (unless (it be) that Allah willeth) it for you, (the Lord of Creation) the Lord of all that which has a soul and creeps on the face of the earth, from the inhabitants of the heaven and of the earth'. 
082/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (When the heaven is cleft asunder): (When the heaven is cleft asunder) by the descent of the Lord-a descent without modality-and the angels and whatever He wills of His command,
082/002:(When the planets are dispersed) on the face of the earth,
082/003:(When the seas are poured forth) into each other, the sweet into the salty, such that they become one sea,
082/004:(And the sepulchres are overturned) the dead in them are taken out,
082/005:(A soul) every soul at that point (will know what it hath sent before (it)) of good or evil (and what left behind) of good or evil wont; it is also said this means: it will know the acts of obedience it offered and those it missed.
082/006:(O man!) i.e. O disbelieving man; here referring specifically to Kildah Ibn Usayd (What hath made thee careless concerning thy Lord) when you disbelieved in Him, (the Bountiful) the Forgiving,
082/007:(Who created thee) a living being from a sperm drop, (then fashioned) in the womb of your mother, (then proportioned thee) then made your stature erect?
082/008:(Into whatsoever form He will, He casteth thee) if He wills He makes you resemble your paternal or maternal uncles, He can make you handsome or ugly; and if He wills He can turn you into the form of an ape or swine, or the like of them.
082/009:(Nay) truly, (but they) the Quraysh (deny the Judgement) and the Reckoning.
082/010:(Lo! there are above you guardians) among the angels who guard and preserve your works,
082/011:(Generous) who are honoured in the sight of Allah and completely surrendered to Him (and recording) they record your works,
082/012:(Who know (all) that ye do) and say of good and evil and record all of it.
082/013:(Lo! the righteous) who are true in their faith: Abu Bakr and his believing brothers (verily will be in delight) in the Garden whose bliss is everlasting.
082/014:(And lo! the wicked) Kildah and his fellow disbelievers (verily will be in hell;
082/015:They will burn therein) they will enter the Fire (on the Day of Judgement) on the Day of Reckoning and Judgement between created beings,
082/016:(And will not) i.e. the disbelievers (be absent thence) whence they enter it.
082/017:(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what the Day of Judgement is!) what is the Day of Reckoning. (Again, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad
082/018:(what the Day of Judgement is!) what the Day of Reckoning is. He said this to arouse his astonishment, in order to magnify such a Day.
082/019:Allah the explained to him, saying: (A day on which no soul) no believing soul (hath power at all) no power to save or intercede (for any (other) soul) for any disbelieving soul. (The (absolute) command) sentencing and judging between people (on that day is Allah's) is in Allah's hands; none other than Him has that in his power and none will challenge Him about it'. 
083/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying: (Woe unto the defrauders): (Woe) severe punishment (unto the defrauders) in weighing and measurement; this refers to the people of Medina who used to cheat in weighing and measurement before the coming of the Prophet (pbuh) and so this surah was revealed to the Prophet (pbuh) on his way when he was migrating to Medina:
083/002:Allah then explained who these defrauders are, saying: (Those who when they take the measure from mankind) those who, when they buy from people and weigh or measure that which they buy for themselves, (demand it full) they weigh and measure their merchandise in full,
083/003:(But if they measure unto them) but when they measure for others (or weigh for them, they cause them loss) they decrease the measurement or the weight and behave very badly; it is also said that the above means: severe punishment on that day is unto the defrauders in the prayer, the poor-due, fasting and other acts of worship.
083/004:(Do such (men)) those who deal in fraud in weight and measurement (not consider) not know and believe (that they will be raised again) brought back to life
083/005:Unto an awful Day) the Day of Judgement whose horrors are great,
083/006:(The day when (all) mankind stand) after emerging from the graves (before the Lord of the Worlds) the Lord of every living being who walks on the earth and the Lord of the dwellers of heaven? When the Prophet (pbuh) read to them this surah, they repented and started giving full weight and measurement.
083/007:(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but the record of the vile) the works of the disbelievers (is in Sijjin
083/008:Ah! what will convey unto thee what Sijjin is) what is in Sijjin! This is mentioned by way of aggrandizement of Sijjin.
083/009:(A written record) He says: the works of the children of Adam are written on a green rock under the seventh earth; this is Sijjin.
083/010:(Woe) severe punishment (unto the repudiators) unto the deniers of faith and the resurrection (on that day) the Day of Judgement!
083/011:(Those who deny the Day of Judgement) and the Reckoning which will take place in it
083/012:(Which none denieth) i.e. none denies the Day of Judgement (save each criminal transgressor) save each sinful and unjust person who transgresses against the Truth, such as al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi,
083/013:(Who, when thou readest unto him) unto al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah (Our revelations) the Quran explaining the commands and prohibitions, (saith: (Mere) fables of the men of old) this is nothing but the lies and idle talk of the people of old.
083/014:(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but that which they have earned) which they have done and said in their state of idolatry (is rust upon their hearts) Allah has sealed the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Day of Judgement; it is also said that the accumulation of sins blackens the heart and this is what is meant by the rust of hearts.
083/015:(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but surely on that day) the Day of Judgement (they) i.e. the deniers of the Day of Judgement (will be covered from (the mercy of) their Lord) they will be prevented from beholding their Lord while the believers will behold Him.
083/016:(Then lo! they verily will burn in hell) then they will enter the Fire,
083/017:(And it will be said (unto them)) the keepers of hell will say to them when they enter it: (This is that which ye used to deny) this is the chastisement which you used to claim it will never happen.
083/018:(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but the record of the righteous) the works of those who are true in their faith (is in Illiyyin
083/019:Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad (what Illiyyin is!) what is in Illiyyin.
083/020:(A written record) it is said that the works of the righteous are written on tablets made of green chrysolite which are placed above the seventh heaven below the Throne of the Beneficent; this is Illiyyin,

089/011:(Who (all) were rebellious (to Allah) in these lands) they rebelled and declared their disbelief in the land of Egypt; it is also said that their transgression led them to this,
089/012:(And multiplied iniquity) and multiplied killing innocent people and spread their idol worship (therein) in the land of Egypt?
089/013:(Therefore thy Lord poured on them the disaster of His punishment) your Lord sent on them a severe punishment.
089/014:(Lo! thy Lord) O Muhammad (is ever watchful) He says: they, as well as all created beings, will have to go through Him; it is also said that this means: the angels of your Lord will be on the Bridge over hell stopping people at seven different stopping positions at which they will ask them about seven traits.
089/015:(As for man) the disbelieving man, in reference here to Ubayy Ibn Khalaf; and it is also said: Umayyah Ibn Khalaf, (whenever his Lord trieth him) whenever his Lord tests him with wealth, richness or means of living (by honouring him) by giving him abundant wealth, (and is gracious unto him) and expands for him his means of living, (he saith: My Lord honoureth me) by giving me wealth and means of living.
089/016:(But whenever He trieth him) whenever He tests him with poverty (by straitening his means of life) by tightening his means of living, (he saith: My Lord despiseth me) by giving me poverty and tightening my means of living.
089/017:(Nay) this is a reply to them: No, but the honour I bestow is due to My acknowledgment of some My servants and the success I give to them, while My despising is because I turn away from some servants and completely forsake them, (but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan) you do not acknowledge the right of the orphan when he is under your care.
089/018:(And urge not) yourselves or others (on the feeding of the poor) giving alms to the poor,
089/019:(And ye devour heritages) inheritances (with devouring greed
089/020:And love wealth with abounding love.
089/021:Nay) this is also a reply to them, (but when the earth is ground to atoms, grinding, grinding) He says: when the earth is quaked again and again,
089/022:(And thy Lord shall come) a coming without any modality (with angels, rank on rank) like the ranks of the people of the life of the world when praying,
089/023:(And hell is brought near) with 70,000 registers, with each register 70,000 angels leading it to the place of mustering, and then they reveal them (that day) the Day of Judgement; (on that day man) the disbelieving man; i.e. Ubayy Ibn Khalaf and Umayyah Ibn Khalaf (will remember) will be admonished, (but how will the remembrance (then avail him)) when the time for being admonished has passed?
089/024:(He will say: Ah, would that) wishing: if only (I had sent before me (some provision) for my life!) if only I have worked in my previous perishing life to this everlasting life.
089/025:(None punisheth as He will punish on that day) on the Day of Judgement!
089/026:(None bindeth as He then will bind) this can also be understood to mean: none punishes like this and none will inflict that kind of punishment except Allah.
089/027:(But ah! thou soul at peace) which is safe from Allahs chastisement, true in its profession of Allahs divine Oneness, grateful for the blessings Allah bestowed upon it, patient with the trials of Allah, pleased with things decreed by Allah, and content with that which Allah gives!
089/028:(Return unto thy Lord) return to that which Allah has prepared for you in the Garden; and it is also said this means: return to your master: the body, (content) with Allahs reward (in His good pleasure) because of its belief in Allahs divine Oneness!
089/029:(Enter thou among My bondmen) enter you among My friends!
089/030:(Enter thou My Garden) which I have prepared for you!' 
090/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Nay, I swear by this city): (Nay, I swear by this city) He says: I swear by the city of Mecca
090/002:(And thou art an indweller of this city) and it is also said that this means: Allah has made lawful for you in this city that which he did not make lawful to anyone before or after you; and it is also said that this means: you are excused regarding that which you do in this city.
090/003:(And the begetter and that which he begat) the begetter is Adam and that which his sons begat; and it is also said this means: the begetter refers to the person who can have children, whether this person is a man or a woman, while that which he begat refers to the men or women who cannot have children; Allah swore by all these,
090/004:(We verily have created man) i.e. Kildah Ibn Usayd (in an atmosphere) in an erect form; it is also said that this means: in strife with the matter of the life of this world and of the Hereafter; and it is also said this means: with strength and force:
090/005:(Thinketh he) does the disbelieving man think (that) because of his strength and force (none hath power over him?) i.e. Allah cannot seize and punish him.
090/006:(And he) Kildah Ibn Usayd; and it is also said: al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah (saith: I have destroyed vast wealth) I have spent abundant wealth in enmity towards Muhammad, Allah bless him, and this did not benefit me:
090/007:(Thinketh he) does the disbelieving man deem (that none beholdeth him) that Allah does not see his deeds whether he spends money or not?
090/008:Allah then mentioned the blessings He bestowed upon him, saying: (Did We not assign unto him two eyes) with which he sees
090/009:(And a tongue) with which he speaks (and two lips) which he can join together or separate,
090/010:(And guide him to the parting of the mountain ways?) And We showed him the way of goodness and the way of evil; and it is also that this means: the way to the two breasts.
090/011:(But he hath not attempted the Ascent) He says: but did he go beyond that hurdle which is the Bridge over hell?

090/013:((It is) to free a slave) He says: its crossing requires the freeing of a slave; and it is also said this means: none will cross it save he who has freed a slave,
090/014:(And to feed in the day of hunger) and hardship
090/015:(An orphan near of kin,
090/016:Or some poor wretch in misery) and who has nothing,

090/018:(Their place will be on the right hand) those who are given their register in their right hands are the inhabitants of the Garden.
090/019:(But those who disbelieve Our revelations) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran, i.e. Kildah and his host, (their place will be on the left hand) those who are given their register in their left hand are the inhabitants of the Fire.

091/010:(And he is indeed a failure) he is in loss (who stunteth it) who leads to sin, error and forsakenness.
091/011:(The tribe of) Thamud) the folk of Salih (denied (the Truth) in their rebellious pride) He says: their transgression led them to this.

091/013:(And the messenger of Allah) Salih (said) that is before they hamstrung the she-camel: (It is the she-camel of Allah) leave the she-camel of Allah alone, (so let her drink!) i.e. and let her drink in peace!
091/014:(But they denied him) they denied the message brought by Salih, (and they hamstrung her) they hamstrung the she-camel, (so Allah doomed them for their sin) so Allah destroyed them because of killing the she-camel and disbelieving in Salih (and razed (their dwellings)) killing the old and the young among them.
091/015:(He dreadeth not the sequel (of events)) and it is also said this means: and He dreads not the one who instigated it'.

092/002:(And the day resplendent) and the day when it clears the darkness of night.
092/003:(And Him Who hath created) and by Him Who has created the (male and female,
092/004:Lo! your effort) your work (is dispersed (towards diverse ends)) there are those who oppose and disbelieve in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran and there are those who believe in Muhammad (pbuh); there are those who strive for Paradise and there are those who strive for hell. This is why Allah made the oath.
092/005:(As for him who giveth) to charity from his wealth for the sake of Allah and bought nine believers who were in the hands of the disbelievers who tortured them to renounce their religion; this person bought them and then freed them (and is dutiful (towards Allah)) and wards off disbelief, idolatry and indecencies

092/014:(Therefore have I warned you) of people of Mecca by means of the Quran (of the flaming Fire
092/015:Which only the most wretched must endure) which only the wretched, as in Allahs foreknowledge, will enter,
092/016:(He who denieth) Allahs divine Oneness; and it is also said: who falls short in obeying Allah (and turneth away) from faith; and it is also said: from repentance.
092/017:(Far removed from it) from the Fire (will be the righteous
092/018:Who giveth his wealth) in the way of Allah, i.e. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (that he may grow (in goodness)) intending by that Allahs Countenance alone,
092/019:(And none hath with him any favour for reward,
092/020:Except as seeking (to fulfil) the purpose of his Lord Most High) except seeking the good pleasure of his Lord the Most High, Who is higher than everything.
092/021:(He verily will be content) he will be given of reward and honour until he is pleased, i.e. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his fellow believers'. 
093/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allahs saying (By the morning hours): (By the morning hours) He says: Allah swears by the whole day
093/002:(And by the night when it is stillest) and by the night when it becomes dark,
093/003:(Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee) your Lord has not left you since He inspired you (nor doth He hate thee) since He loved you; this is the reason for Allahs oath, this was revealed after the revelations from Allah stopped for 15 nights because the Prophet (pbuh) forgot to say " if Allah wills " when he promised the idolaters to answer their questions. And because the revelations stopped for this period of time the idolaters said: the Lord of Prophet has forsaken him and He hates him.
093/004:(And verily the latter portion will be better for thee than the former) He says: the reward of the Hereafter is better for you than the reward of the life of the world.
093/005:(And verily thy Lord will give unto thee) in the Hereafter of intercession (so that thou wilt be content) until you are content.
093/006:Allah then mentioned His blessings upon the Prophet (pbuh) saying (Did He not find thee) O Muhammad (an orphan) without a father or mother (and protect (thee)) and joined you to your uncle Abu Talib and sufficed you your provision? The Prophet (pbuh) said: " Yes, O Gabriel! "
093/007:Gabriel then said: (Did He not find thee) O Muhammad (wandering) among people in error (and direct (thee)) and guided you by means of prophethood? The Prophet (pbuh) said: " Yes, O Gabriel! "
093/008:And he also said: (Did He not find thee) O Muhammad (destitute) poor (and enrich (thee)) with the wealth of Khadijah; and it is also said this means: and made you content with that which He gave you? The Prophet (pbuh) said: " Yes, O Gabriel! "
093/009:So he also said: (Therefore the orphan oppress not) do not transgress on him nor deride him,
093/010:(Therefore the beggar drive not away) nor rebuke,
093/011:(Therefore of the bounty of thy Lord) through prophethood and Islam (be thy discourse) speak to people and let them know about it'. 
094/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said concerning the interpretation of Allahs saying (Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate): (Have We not caused thy bosom to dilate) this is in conjunction with His saying (Did He not find thee destitute and enrich (thee)?), and so Allah says: did We not open your heart for Islam? i.e. did We not soften your heart on the Day of the Covenant through knowledge, understanding, help, reason and certainty, as well as with other things? It is also said this means: did We not expand your heart through prophethood? And the Prophet (pbuh) said: "Yes, indeed!"
094/002:He said again: (And eased thee of the burden) We lifted your sins from you
094/003:(Which weighed down thy back?) It is also said: prophethood weighed down your back; And the Prophet (pbuh) said: " Yes, indeed! "
094/004:(And exalted thy fame) and raised your voice with the call to prayer, supplication and testification of faith, such that you are mentioned just as I am? And the Prophet (pbuh) said: " Yes, indeed! "
094/005:Allah then said to comfort His prophet about his poverty and the hardships he faced, saying: (But lo! with hardship goeth ease,
094/006:Lo! with hardship goeth ease;
094/007:So when thou art relieved) when you finish from military expeditions, jihad and fighting, (still toil) in worship; and it is also said this means: when you finish from the prescribed prayers, make supplications
094/008:(And strive to please thy Lord) and ask your needs from your Lord'. 
095/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (By the fig and the olive): (By the fig and the olive) He says: Allah swears by the fig, this fig of yours, and the olive, this olive of yours; it is also said the fig and the olive refer to two mountains in Historic Syria; it is also said that the fig refers to the hill upon which Jerusalem is built while the olive refers to the mountain upon which Damascus is built,
095/002:(By Mount Sinai) and He swears by the mountain of Thubayr which is the mountain of Midian where Allah spoke to Moses (pbuh),
095/003:(And by this land made safe) and He swears by Mecca which is made safe in that whoever enters it is safe;
095/004:(Surely We created man) the disbelieving man, referring here to al-Walid Ibn al-Mughirah, and it is also said it refers to Kildah Ibn Usayd (of the best stature) in the best of forms; and this is the reason why the oath was made.
095/005:(Then We reduced him) in the Hereafter (to the lowest of the low) i.e. the Fire; it is also said that the above means: We have created the children of Adam in the best of forms when they are in the pick of their youth, then We reduce them to abject old age whereby no good deed is recorded in their favour except that which they used to do in their youth and prime,
095/006:(Save those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran (and do good works) and do acts of obedience in private between themselves and their Lord, (and theirs is a reward unfailing) their reward is undiminished and unspoilt, good deeds will still be written for them even in old age and after they die.
095/007:(So who henceforth) i.e. after what I have mentioned to you of the transformation of youth and old age, life and death (will give the lie to thee) O Muhammad (about the judgement) about the Day of Reckoning? It is also said this means: what has driven you, O Kildah Ibn Usayd and Walid Ibn al-Mughirah, to deny the Day of Judgement?
095/008:(Is not Allah the most conclusive of all judges?) Is not Allah the most just of those who are just and the best of those who are best and is, therefore, able to bring you back to life, Walid!' 
096/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Read): (Read) He says: Read, O Muhammad, the Quran; this is the first revelation that Gabriel brought down: (In the name of thy Lord) by the command of your Lord (Who createth) the created beings,
096/002:(Createth man) i.e. the son of Adam (from a clot) and the Prophet (pbuh) said: "what shall I read?" And Gabriel read to him the first four verses of this surah.
096/003:He said to him: (Read) the Quran, O Muhammad: (And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous) and your Lord is Clement and forgives the ignorance of the servants,
096/004:(Who teacheth by the pen) Who teaches writing by the pen,
096/005:(Teacheth man) writing with the pen (that which be knew not) before this; it is also said: He taught man the names of all things which he previously did not know.
096/006:(Nay, but verily) O Muhammad (man) i.e. the disbeliever (is rebellious) is a wanton, he moves from one position to another with regard to his food, drink, clothing and mount
096/007:(That he thinketh himself independent) of Allah because of his wealth!
096/008:(Lo! unto thy Lord) O Muhammad (is the return) of all created beings in the Hereafter.
096/009:Then it was revealed about Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham when he wanted to step on the neck of the Prophet (pbuh) while he was in prayer: (Hast thou seen him) O Muhammad (who dissuadeth
096/010:A slave) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (when he prayeth) to Allah?
096/011:(Hast thou seen if he (relieth) on the guidance (of Allah)) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) is following the guidance: prophethood and Islam
096/012:(Or enjoineth piety) and enjoins belief in Allahs divine Oneness?
096/013:(Hast thou seen if he denieth (Allahs guidance)) and Abu Jahl disbelieved in Allahs divine Oneness (and is froward) and turned away from faith?
096/014:(Is he) Abu Jahl (then unaware that Allah seeth) what he did to the Prophet (pbuh)?
096/015:(Nay) truly, O Muhammad, (but if he cease not) if Abu Jahl does not repent of harming the Prophet (pbuh). (We will seize him by the forelock
096/016:The lying) about Allah, (sinful forelock) that ascribes partners to Allah
096/017:(Then let him call upon his henchmen) his folk and companions!
096/018:(We will call the guards of hell) i.e. the keepers of hell.
096/019:(Nay) truly, Muhammad! (Obey not thou him) i.e. obey not Abu Jahl when he wants you not to pray to your Lord. (But prostrate thyself) to your Lord, (and draw near (unto Allah)) through prostration. 
097/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Lo! We revealed it): (Lo! We revealed it) He says: We sent Gabriel with the entire Quran to the scribes of the nether heaven (on the Night of Power) on the night of judgement and decree; it is also said this means: on a night blessed with forgiveness and mercy, and then it was revealed to the Prophet (pbuh) in instalments.
097/002:(Ah, what will convey unto thee) O Muhammad-this is said out of glorification of this night-(what the Night of Power is) what the merit of the Night of Power is!
097/003:He then explained its merit by saying: (The Night of Power is better than a thousand months) He says: works in this night are better than works performed in 1,000 months which do not include such a night.
097/004:(The angels and the Spirit) Gabriel with them (descend therein) at the beginning of the Night of Power, (by the permission of their Lord) by the command of their Lord, (with all decrees.
097/005:(That night is) Peace) He says: they greet the greeting of peace those who fast and those who pray, on that day, from among the nation of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) (until the rising of the dawn) He says: its merit and grace lasts until the rise of dawn'. 
098/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said regarding the interpretation of Allahs saying (Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture): (Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture) i.e. the Jews and Christians (and the idolaters) the Arab idolaters (could not have left off (erring)) could not have remained in their denial of Muhammad (pbuh) the Quran and Islam (till the clear proof came unto them) until clarification of what is in their Scriptures, the Scriptures of the Jews and Christians, came to them. There is another way of understanding the above: those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture, before the advent Muhammad (pbuh) such as Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, and those who ascribed partners to Allah before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such as Abu Bakr and his fellow Arabs, would not have desisted from their disbelief and idolatry until the clear proof came to them, i.e. until Muhammad (pbuh) came to them.
098/002:(A messenger from Allah) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (reading) to them (purified pages) pages purified from idolatry
098/003:(Containing) i.e. the page of Muhammad (pbuh) contains (correct scriptures) a religion and a straight and just way that contains no crookedness.
098/004:(Nor were the People of the Scripture divided) those who were given the Torah, i.e. Kab Ibn al-Ashraf and his host, did not differ about Muhammad (pbuh) the Quran and Islam (until after the clear proof came unto them) until the clarification of what is in their Scripture regarding the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) came to them.
098/005:(And they are ordered) in all the Scriptures (naught else than to serve Allah) nothing else but to profess Allahs divine Oneness, (keeping religion pure for Him) through the profession of Allahs divine Oneness, (as men by nature upright) as ones surrendered unto Him, (and to establish worship) and perform the five daily prayers after declaring their profession in Allahs divine Oneness (and to pay the poor-due) from their wealth after that. Allah then mentioned belief in Allahs divine Oneness, saying: (That) i.e. belief in Allahs divine Oneness (is true religion) the religion of truth, straight without any crookedness; it is also said that this means: that, i.e. belief in Allahs divine Oneness, is the religion of the angels; and it is also said this means: it is the religion of those who are by nature upright; and it is also said this means: the religion of Abraham.
098/006:(Lo! those who disbelieve) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran, (among the People of the Scripture and the idolaters) i.e. the idolaters among the people of Mecca, (will abide in fire of hell) never to die therein or leave it. (They are the worst of created beings.
098/007:(And) lo! those who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Quran, such as Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his companions (and do good works) acts of obedience privately between themselves and their Lord (are the best of created beings.
098/008:Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden) the chamber of the Beneficent, the source of the prophets and those near to Him (beneath which) beneath whose trees, habitations and rooms (rivers flow) rivers of wine, water, honey and milk, (wherein they dwell forever) they remain in Paradise for ever never to die or leave it. (Allah hath pleasure in them) i.e. in their faith and works (and they have pleasure in Him) in His reward and bestowal of honour upon Him. (This) i.e. the Gardens and good pleasure (is (in store) for him who feareth his Lord) is for him who believes in Allah's divine Oneness such as Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and his companions and 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers'. 
099/001:And from his narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas that he said about the interpretation of Allahs saying (When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake): (When Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake) He says: the earth is shaken and quaking and all that which is on it of trees, mountains and building is crumbling down
099/002:(And Earth yieldeth up her burdens) and the Earth brings out her dead and treasures,
099/003:(And man) i.e. the disbeliever (saith: What aileth her?) He says this in astonishment from the horror he sees
099/004:(That day) when the earth is shaken (she will relate her chronicles) the earth will inform about the good and evil that were done on its surface,
099/005:(Because thy Lord inspires her) because your Lord gives her leave to talk.
099/006:(That day) when the earth speaks (mankind will issue forth in scattered groups) a group will go to Paradise, these are the believers, and a group will go to hell, and these are the disbelievers (to be shown their deeds) what they have done of good or evil when they were in the life of the world.
