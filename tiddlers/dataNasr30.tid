078/001: About what do they question one another?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>They</i> is interpreted to mean the Prophet’s tribe, the Quraysh (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), most of whose leaders rejected Muhammad and the Quran at the time of the revelation of this verse, though this particular reference is not understood to limit the more general implications of the <i>sūrah</i>.</p>
078/002: About the Great Tiding,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The Great Tiding</i> (<i>al-naba<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span> al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>īm;</i> cf. 38:67) refers to the Resurrection; the Quran itself (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), called the <i>Mighty Quran</i> (<i>al-qur<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>ān al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>īm;</i> 15:87); or the Prophet Muhammad (R). The content of the <i>sūrah</i> best supports the reference to the Resurrection in general or to the Day of Resurrection, which is also referred to as <i>a tremendous day</i> (<i>yawm <span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ā<span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>īm</i>) when considered in relation to the punishment received by disbelievers (see, e.g., 6:15; 19:37; 26:189; 83:5).</p>
078/003: regarding which they differ.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is understood as an allusion to the distinction between two parties: those who accept and confirm the Quran and the Prophet and those who reject and deny them (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Ash<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>arite theologians, who oppose a metaphorical understanding of Resurrection, have viewed it as an allusion to the different degrees and modes of rejection and denial (Qu, R), since some believe in certain aspects of the message but not in others, and some believe in a spiritual resurrection but not in a bodily one.</p>
078/004: Nay, but they will know!
078/005: Then indeed they will know!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Nay,</i> translating the emphatic particle <i>kallā</i>, could alternately be rendered “truly” or “indeed,” as it is in v. 5. If the two verses are both addressed to the disbelievers, the repetition can be seen as emphasis; they can also be viewed as addressed to two groups: the first to the disbelievers, the second to the believers (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). When both are viewed as an address to disbelievers, v. 4 can be seen as a reference to knowing the truth of the Resurrection and v. 5 to knowing the truth of the punishment; or v. 4 can be seen as a reference to the punishment in this world and v. 5 to the punishment in the Hereafter (R). If addressed to the two groups, vv. 21<span class="HCSQ">–</span>30 would correspond to what the disbelievers <i>will know,</i> and vv. 31<span class="HCSQ">–</span>36 to what the believers <i>will know</i>.</p>
078/006: Did We not make the earth a resting place,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>Like 22:2 and 27:61, this verse indicates both that God has made all that is upon the earth subservient to human beings (see, e.g., 22:65; 31:20) and that He has placed guidance upon the earth, as in 43:10: <i>He it is Who made the earth a cradle for you and made paths for you therein, that haply you may be guided.</i></p>
078/007: and the mountains stakes,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>Several verses refer to God’s having made the mountains firm; see 21:30<span class="HCSQ">–</span>31c. The mention of mountains here is also connected to the <i>resting place</i> in v. 6, for God <i>has made places of refuge for you in the mountains</i> (16:81) and in other verses mountains are referred to as places with dwellings and houses (see 7:74; 15:82; 26:149).</p>
078/008: and create you in pairs,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Pairs</i> (<i>azwāj</i>) could be a reference to the male and female, as in 53:45: <i>And that He creates the two</i> (<i>zawjayn</i>)<i>—male and female,</i> which are said to be “mates” (<i>azwāj</i>) created <i>from a single soul</i> (4:1; 7:189; 39:6). In this sense, this verse follows upon v. 6, for human beings find rest and repose in their mates, as in 30:21: <i>And among His signs is that He created mates for you from among yourselves, that you might find rest in them, and He established affection and mercy between you</i> (see also 7:189). The verse can also be seen as a reference to the creation of all things in pairs, as in 51:49, <i>And of all things We created pairs, that haply you may remember,</i> which is understood by some as a reference to the manner in which human beings can be said to know things through their opposites.</p>
078/009: and make your sleep repose,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span>Sleep provides rest for the body and a break from external activity. Some relate this verse to 6:60, <i>He it is Who takes your souls by night,</i> in which the body is as if dead; for sleep as “a minor <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1464" title="1464"/>death,” see 6:60c; 39:42; and the essay “Death, Dying, and the Afterlife in the Quran.”</p>
078/010: and make the night a garment,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be seen as a continuation of v. 9, as <i>He it is Who made the night for you, that you might rest therein</i> (10:67), and <i>He has made the night for repose</i> (6:96). On the one hand, night as a <i>garment</i> implies that it is a protection and comfort. On the other hand, night allows the true nature of a person to manifest, as the cover of night facilitates the actions of those who incline toward wrongdoing. It also provides a stillness that facilitates devotion and vigil, as in 73:6: <i>Truly the vigil of the night is firmest in tread and most upright for speech</i>; for the importance of night vigil, see 11:114; 17:79; 20:130; 21:20; 25:63<span class="HCSQ">–</span>64; 50:40; 52:49; 73:2, 6, 20; 76:26; 73:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2c; 73:20c. In his <i>Makkan Openings</i> (<i>al-Futū<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>āt al-Makkiyyah</i>), Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Arabī mentions that the night is a cloak for “the people of the night” (<i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>āb al-layl</i>), because it covers them from others and creates a spiritual retreat (<i>khalwah</i>) for them.</p>
078/011: and the day for livelihood?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11</span><span class="hide">  </span>When v. 9 is viewed in relation to 6:60, this verse can be viewed in relation to another phrase in 6:60, <i>by day He resurrects you</i>. Together vv. 9<span class="HCSQ">–</span>11 indicate the cycles of rest and activity essential to the functioning of the created order. The alternation of night and day is referred to as an important sign in over two dozen verses; e.g., 24:44: <i>God alternates the night and the day. Truly in that is a lesson for those possessed of sight;</i> for vv. 9<span class="HCSQ">–</span>11, cf. 25:47. For other verses that contrast night and day, see 27:86; 28:73; 40:61.</p>
078/012: And [did We not] build above you seven firmaments,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">12</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Seven firmaments</i> is a reference to the <i>seven heavens</i> (2:29; 17:44; 23:17; 41:12; 65:12; 67:3; 71:15). <i>Firmaments</i> translates <i>shidād,</i> which also means “strong, solid, and firm,” thus implying that the heavens have no fissure and are not subject to the vicissitudes of this world (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). For the significance of the seven heavens, see 23:17c.</p>
078/013: and make a radiant lamp,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">13</span><span class="hide">  </span>For v. 12<span class="HCSQ">–</span>13, cf. 71:16. <i>Radiant lamp</i> is understood by most as a reference to the sun (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), although some interpret it as a reference to the Prophet Muhammad, as in 33:45<span class="HCSQ">–</span>46, where he is said to have been sent <i>as a luminous lamp</i> (see also 25:61).</p>
078/014: and send down water pouring from the rain clouds,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Rain clouds,</i> translating <i>mu<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>irāt,</i> is read by some as “the winds” that bring the rain clouds (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). A small minority read it as a reference to “the heavens” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
078/015: that We might produce grain and plants thereby,
078/016: and luxuriant gardens?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16</span><span class="hide">  </span>God remains the primary cause for all things. Therefore, it is not the rain that produces grain, plants and gardens, as some are inclined to believe; rather, it is God Himself who does so by means of rain, since God <i>made every living thing from water</i> (21:30; see also 24:25; 25:54).</p>
078/017: Truly the Day of Division is a Moment Appointed,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 44:40. The Day of Resurrection is referred to here and elsewhere (e.g., 44:40; 77:13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14; 77:38) as <i>the Day of Division,</i> because it provides the ultimate distinction between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, light and dark. It is <i>a Moment Appointed</i> because it is guaranteed, and <i>God will not fail the tryst</i> (3:9; 13:31; 39:20). For <i>the Day of Division,</i> see 77:13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14; 77:38.</p>
078/018: a day when the trumpet is blown and you come forth in throngs,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18</span><span class="hide">  </span>In 39:68 the Archangel Seraphiel is said to blow the trumpet twice: at the first blast, all of creation will swoon (see 69:13); at the second, all souls will rise from their graves and be gathered before God (see 50:20<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21; 64:9). This verse may refer to the fact that the trumpet is blown twice or to the second blowing of the trumpet (see 39:68c). <i>Throngs</i> (<i>afwāj</i>) is taken by some to indicate that human communities will come in “groups” (<i>afwāj</i>), with each community gathered behind its prophet (see 17:71c). After all souls are gathered, they will be divided according to those who must be reckoned for their bad deeds and those who are rewarded for their good deeds. When asked about the <i>afwāj</i>, the Prophet said that on the Day of Resurrection his community <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1465" title="1465"/>(<i>ummah</i>) would be resurrected in ten <i>afwāj,</i> which he then enumerated.</p>
078/019: and the sky is opened as if it were gates,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">19</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 54:11: <i>So We opened the gates of the sky with pouring water</i>. The word translated <i>sky</i> and <i>Heaven</i> in these two verses is the same, <i>samā<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>.</i> Most interpret v. 19 as an allusion to the descent of the angels (IK, Q), as in 25:25, where it is referred to as <i>the Day when the sky is split open with clouds and the angels are sent down</i>. For a more extensive discussion of the opening of the <i>sky</i> or <i>Heaven,</i> see 39:73c.</p>
078/020: and the mountains are set in motion as if they were a mirage.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">20</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 81:3. Several verses indicate that the mountains will be dispatched on the Day of Judgment, as in 27:88: <i>And thou seest the mountains that thou dost suppose are solid pass away like clouds—the work of God, Who perfects all things;</i> see also 18:47; 70:8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9; 73:14; 101:5.</p>
078/021: Truly Hell lies in ambush,
078/022: a place unto which the rebellious return<p class="indent"><span class="red1">21<span class="HCSQ">–</span>22</span><span class="hide">  </span>Hell is the place to which those who rebel against the truth are sent. It will come upon them like an <i>ambush</i> when they die, because they had been oblivious to the truth in this world.</p>
078/023: to tarry therein for ages.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">23</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>For ages</i> (<i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>qāban</i>) indicates periods of time. The vast majority of commentators maintain that it indicates Hell will be eternal, with one period following after another endlessly. Others say it indicates that, although Hell is “endless” in relation to our understanding of time; it is of limited duration, limited “ages,” in the absolute sense. The relativity of Hell in relation to the Absolute is alluded to in a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “On the Day of Judgment, those who deserve the Garden will enter the Garden, and those who deserve the Fire, the Fire. Thereupon God will say, ‘Take out everyone in whose heart there was as much faith as a grain of a mustard seed’ [see 4:40c]. Then they will be taken out already blackened and will be cast into the River of Life. Then they will sprout as an herb sprouts by the side of a stream. Do you not see how it comes out yellow and budding?”</p>
078/024: They taste therein neither coolness nor drink,
078/025: save boiling liquid and a cold, murky fluid,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">24<span class="HCSQ">–</span>25</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Therein</i> can be taken as a reference to <i>ages</i> or to Hell. The former implies that there will be <i>ages</i> in which they drink of nothing other than <i>boiling liquid</i> (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>amīm</i>) and <i>cold, murky fluid</i> (<i>ghassāq</i>), followed by <i>ages</i> in which they drink of other beverages or experience other forms of punishment. The second implies that they will drink of these forever. The <i>boiling liquid</i> (cf. 6:70; 10:4; 22:19; 37:67; 38:57; 40:72; 44:46, 48; 47:15; 56:42, 54; 88:5) indicates something that has reached its maximum temperature, but can also indicate severe, painful cold. The <i>cold, murky fluid</i> (cf. 10:4; 38:57) is said to be an unbearably cold liquid with an intolerable stench gathered from the pus, sweat, tears, and wounds of the people of Hell (IK). This verse and similar verses provide an interesting window onto the nature of Hell<span class="HCSQ">—</span>it is characterized not just by fire and heat but by extremes at both ends of the spectrum of temperature and all of the tension such extremes entail, whereas the Garden is described as a place of perfect tranquility. Although in the garden there are all the wine, fruits, and pure companions one could want, there is no indulgence. Peace and joy lie in moderation; torture lies in the extremes.</p>
078/026: a fitting recompense.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">26</span><span class="hide">  </span>It is a <i>fitting recompense</i> in that it is proportionate to the offense committed, for <i>the recompense of an evil is an evil like unto it</i> (42:40) and <i>God wrongs not His servants</i> (3:182; see also 10:44; 22:10).</p>
078/027: Truly they anticipated not a reckoning,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">27</span><span class="hide">  </span>As the disbelievers did not believe in the Resurrection and Divine Judgment, they did not anticipate the reckoning and did not fear it or seek to avoid it by accounting for their own actions (Q). Their recompense is therefore of their own doing, since it is they who <i>have wronged themselves</i> (3:117; 10:44; 16:118).</p>
078/028: and denied Our signs with utter denial.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">28</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Our signs</i> indicates all aspects of revelation. <i>With utter denial,</i> translating <i>kadhdhāb,</i> <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1466" title="1466"/>could also be rendered “as deniers” if read as <i>kudhdhāb</i> (Q, R, Z); or <i>kudhdhāb</i> could be read in the singular as a name of emphasis and thus rendered “as does a great denier.”</p>
078/029: And everything have We recorded in a book.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">29</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse refers to the book in which all deeds are recorded by angels (see 86:4; commentary on 43:80; 50:17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>18; 82:10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12) or to the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> (85:22; Q). Since the disbelievers’ transgressions are as described in vv. 27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>28 and since God has recorded everything, theirs is <i>a fitting recompense</i> (v. 26); cf. 36:12. <i>In a book,</i> translating <i>kitāban,</i> could also be rendered “in writing” (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
078/030: So taste! For We shall not increase you in aught but punishment!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">30</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>So taste</i> means, “<i>Taste the punishment</i> [see 3:106, 181; 4:56; 6:30; 7:39; 8:35, 50; 10:52; 22:22; 32:14, 20; 34:42; 46:34] that you have brought upon yourselves through your disbelief and your actions.” According to a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “This verse is the most severe [verse] against the people of the Fire” (IK, R, Z). See also 17:97, which says of the punishment, <i>Every time it abates, We shall increase for them a blazing flame;</i> and 4:56, which promises that <i>as often as their skins are consumed, We shall replace them with other skins, that they may taste the punishment.</i></p>
078/031: Truly the reverent shall have a place of triumph,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">31</span><span class="hide">  </span>For the Quranic understanding of <i>the reverent,</i> see 2:2c. Attaining “the Garden” is referred to as <i>the great triumph</i> in over a dozen verses; for the blessings of Paradise, see commentary on 5:119; 44:51<span class="HCSQ">–</span>57.</p>
078/032: gardens and vineyards,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">32</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Gardens</i> will surround believers on all sides.</p>
078/033: buxom maidens of like age,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">33</span><span class="hide">  </span>Maidens with full breasts represent those who will be fully mature, but whose bodies will not suffer the vicissitudes of time. According to some commentaries, all men and women of Paradise will be thirty-three years old. For <i>of like age,</i> see 56:36<span class="HCSQ">–</span>37c.</p>
078/034: and an overflowing cup.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">34</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Overflowing</i> translates <i>dihāq,</i> which has several interpretations: “continuously filled,” “pure,” or most commonly “completely filled” (IK, R). According to the early commentator al-<span class="HCSQ">Ḍ</span>a<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span><span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>āk (d. 212/827), every use of “cup” in the Quran is a reference to paradisal wine (R); e.g., 37:45<span class="HCSQ">–</span>47; 76:6.</p>
078/035: They hear therein neither idle talk nor lying<span class="HCSQ">—</span><p class="indent"><span class="red1">35</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 19:62; 56:25; 88:11. All they hear is <i>Peace</i> (19:62; 56:26), because that is the greeting of the Garden (see, e.g., 10:10; 14:23). <i>Idle talk</i> and <i>lying</i> can be seen to represent the concupiscent and devious tendencies, respectively, as manifested in speech, whereas true speech is pure peace.</p>
078/036: a recompense from thy Lord, a gift abounding<span class="HCSQ">—</span><p class="indent"><span class="red1">36</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Abounding</i> translates <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>isāb,</i> which could also mean “sufficient” (Z). When viewed in relation to v. 26, it could be rendered “appropriate” or “fitting” (R), indicating that the reverent receive what they have earned, as do the deniers.</p>
078/037: the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and whatsoever is between them, the Compassionate, Whom they have no power to address.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">37</span><span class="hide">  </span>Here <i>they</i> is understood by some as a reference to the disbelievers (Q), as in 36:65: <i>On that Day We shall seal their mouths</i>. Others say <i>they</i> refers to all created beings (R). Some say this verse does not indicate speech as such, but that <i>on the Day it comes, no soul shall speak, save by His Leave</i> (11:105; Q).</p>
078/038: That Day the Spirit and the angels stand in rows, none speaking, save one whom the Compassionate permits and who speaks aright.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">38</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The Spirit</i> (<i>al-rū<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span></i>) is open to many interpretations. Even the Quran does not give a definitive explanation, responding instead by saying, <i>They ask thee about the Spirit. Say, “The Spirit is from the Command of my Lord, and you have not been given knowledge, save a little”</i> (17:85). As al-Ghazzālī writes, “‘The Spirit’ is found in the Quran with many meanings” (<i>I<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>yā<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span> <span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ulūm al-dīn, K. al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ilm</i>). Here some say it refers to the Archangel Gabriel (IK, Q, R), as in 26:192<span class="HCSQ">–</span>94, where he is referred to as <i>the Trustworthy Spirit</i> (<i>al-rū<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span> al-amīn</i>). Others say that here <i>the Spirit</i> does not specify a particular angel, but the first <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1467" title="1467"/>creature created by God (Q, R), which may or may not be the Archangel Gabriel. <i>The angels</i> refers to the most noble of angels, the protecting angels who are responsible for recording the deeds of each individual (see commentary on 82:10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12), or all angels. <i>In rows,</i> translating <i><span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>affan,</i> could also mean “in a row.” Some read the verse to mean that <i>the Spirit and the angels</i> stand in a single row; others take it to mean that <i>the Spirit</i> stands alone, while the angels stand in a row (Āl). In relation to 89:22, which refers to the angels coming <i>row upon row,</i> some read <i><span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>affan</i> to mean that the angels stand in many rows (Āl, R). <i>Save one whom the Compassionate permits</i> is interpreted as a reference to those whom God permits to intercede on behalf of others, as in 2:255: <i>Who is there that may intercede with Him save by His Leave?</i> The referent to <i>who speaks aright</i> is then taken by many as those who intercede, since they will only be able to speak aright about those for whom they intercede (Āl, Q, R). Some maintain that this refers to the prophets (IK). Others say <i>who speaks aright</i> means those who say, “There is no god but God” (Q). Some maintain that the verse should be read, “save one whom the Compassionate permits. And he speaks aright,” meaning that after permission has been granted, he cannot but speak aright.</p>
078/039: That is the True Day. So let whosoever will, take a path of return unto his Lord.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">39</span><span class="hide">  </span>It is <i>the True Day,</i> for it is the <i>Day</i> in which <i>there is no doubt</i> (3:9, 25; 4:87; 6:12; 42:7; 45:26). The <i>path of return to</i> the <i>Lord</i> is through belief and good deeds.</p>
078/040: Truly We have warned you of a punishment nigh, on a day when a man beholds what his hands have sent forth, and the disbeliever says, “Oh, would that I were dust!”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">40</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to most, this entire verse points to disbelievers, for disbelievers will behold and dwell upon the evil of their deeds, whereas believers will experience the Forgiveness and Mercy of God. According to others, <i>a man beholds what his hands have sent forth</i> (see 75:13c; 82:5c) refers to believers, who will experience reward for their good deeds, in contrast to disbelievers, who will wish that they were nothing (R). <i>Oh, would that I were dust</i> could indicate that one wishes either to have never been born or to be back in the grave and not resurrected (IK, Q), as in 4:42: <i>On that Day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were level with the earth, and they will conceal no account from God</i> (R). It can also be taken as an indication that those who took pride in their high station in this world will prefer that they had had a low station that had not made them prideful and insolent; see also 69:25<span class="HCSQIt">–</span>27. Many commentaries convey an account that links this verse to the resurrection of animals. Traditional Islamic teachings maintain that all animals will be resurrected. Then God will rectify all injustices between them, and according to many when the judgment between them is finished, He will say to them “Be dust,” and they will all become dust. Upon witnessing this, disbelievers will prefer the fate of the animals to their own and say, <i>Oh, would that I were dust</i> (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>ū).</p><p class="indent">A few commentators interpret <i>the disbeliever</i> as a reference to Satan, who, when he sees the rewards received by believing human beings, wishes that he too had been made of dust or clay, thus altering his previous evaluation: <i>I am better than him. Thou hast created me from fire, while Thou hast created him from clay</i> (7:12; 38:76; Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). In some Shiite commentaries, the Arabic for <i>Oh, would that I were dust, yā laytanī kuntu turāban,</i> is read <i>yā laytanī kuntu turābiyyan,</i> that is, “Oh, would that I were a follower of Abū Turāb,” meaning <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Alī ibn Abī <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>ālib, the first Shiite Imam (Kā, Qm). This would then mean that on the Day of Resurrection all who were not among the followers of the twelve Shiite Imams would wish that they had been. In this sense Shiites may be inverting the pejorative name Turābiyyah (“the followers of Abū Turāb”), which some of their opponents gave to them, and wearing it as a badge of honor.</p>


079/001: By those that wrest violently,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>Regarding the varying interpretations for these verses as referring to different types of angels, different modes of death, or different types and phases of stars and/or other celestial bodies, among other things, al-<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>abarī says that they can be seen as a reference to all of these, for God is swearing by everything that exhibits the characteristics mentioned in these verses. Al-Rāzī advises that we cannot say any of the interpretations are what is meant by God, but that we can say they are possible. He adds another interpretation in which these verses represent five phases in the return of the heart from what is other than God to God: “<i>Those that wrest</i> (<i>al-nāzi<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>āt</i>) are the spirits that move toward (<i>tanzi<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>u ilā</i>) attachment to <i>the most unfailing handhold</i> [2:256; 31:22], or who are being wrested from the love of what is other than God. <i>Those that draw out quickly</i> (<i>al-nāshi<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>āt nash<span class="HCSQ">ṭ</span></i>) means that, after the return from bodily things, [the spirits] take to striving and assuming the character traits of God with utter zeal (<i>nishā<span class="HCSQ">ṭ</span></i>) and great strength. <i>Those that glide serenely</i> is then that, after striving, [the spirits] ‘glide’ in the realm of sovereignty, such that they cross these oceans and swim therein. <i>Those that race to the fore, outstripping</i> is an allusion to the variegation of spirits in the degrees of their journeying unto God, and <i>those that govern affairs</i> is an allusion to the connection between the last levels of humanness and the first degrees of angelhood. So when the human spirits reach their farthest limit, which is the level of <i>outstripping,</i> they connect to the world of the angels, which is what is meant by <i>those that govern affairs</i>. So the first four are what is meant by <i>its oil would well-nigh shine forth</i> [24:35], and the fifth is the fire in His saying, <i>even if no fire had touched it</i> [24:35].”</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Those that wrest</i> are viewed by most as the angels who wrest the souls of disbelievers from the body (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, Z). They do so <i>violently</i> because the souls do not want to face the Judgment. Others see <i>those that wrest</i> as an allusion to the stars or to all celestial bodies (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, Z).</p>
079/002: by those that draw out quickly,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse may be a reference to the angels who draw out the souls of believers who go willingly into the Hereafter (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); though others say it could be another description of the difficulties confronted by disbelievers and hypocrites, because <i>nashi<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>a,</i> here translated <i>draw out,</i> can also imply something that must be pulled out with great force (Q). Others say it refers to the stars as they travel from one horizon to the other; while according to others, vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2 refer to death itself (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), where the soul’s exit from the body is violent for some and gentle for others.</p>
079/003: by those that glide serenely,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is a reference to angels who descend with God’s nourishment, or to the stars, or to ships that sail gently upon the sea (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). When taken as a reference to angels, <i>glide serenely</i> could also be rendered “descend in the early morning.” Mujāhid viewed this as a third reference to death (R): v. 1 refers to the death of disbelievers; v. 2, to the death of believers; and v. 3, to the death of the elect among the believers.</p>
079/004: by those that race to the fore, outstripping,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is a reference to either angels who race to Paradise with human souls, death, or the stars (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>

Some say that it applies to all angels with such responsibilities, while others relate it to the responsibilities mentioned in vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4 (R); and others say it refers only to the Archangels Gabriel, Michael, Azrael, and Seraphiel (Q), each of whom is considered to be responsible for a particular domain. In another interpretation this verse is understood as a reference to the planets (Q), presumably in astrological terms.</p>

Some say <i>the quaker</i> refers to earth and the mountains, for it is <i>a day on which the earth and the mountains shake</i> (73:14), while <i>the successor</i> refers to Heaven and the planets (IK, R). Another opinion is that <i>the quaker</i> refers to the first “shaking” of the earth, and <i>the successor</i> to the second shaking when it is sundered and fades away (R). Others interpret <i>the quaker</i> as a reference to “the event” in which the earth quakes; and still others see it as a reference to the Hour (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), which is said to “quake” (22:1). A minority interpret vv. 6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7 as an allusion to death itself and all that it entails (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>

079/012: They say, “This, then, would be a ruinous return!”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">12</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is the response of those who deny the Resurrection. It is understood to mean that they know that if this were the case, they would be ruined (Q, R).</p>

See in particular 39:68, which maintains that there will be two cries of the trumpet. The present verse is then taken as a reference to the second cry, at which all human beings will be gathered. The reference to <i>a single cry</i> is understood by some to mean that the gathering will occur almost instantly, for as other verses say, <i>Our Command is naught but one, like the blinking of an eye</i> (54:50); and <i>The matter of the Hour is as the blinking of an eye, or nearer still</i> (16:77; IK).</p>
079/014: then, behold, they will be upon a wide expanse.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Wide expanse</i> is interpreted by some as a reference to the face of the earth (IK, Q). Others connect it to the <i>open plain</i> in 18:47 and the <i>barren plain</i> in 20:106 (IK), both of which are seen as allusions to the plain on which all of humanity will be gathered for the Day of Judgment. Still others believe that the <i>wide expanse</i> refers to a plain near Jerusalem, in the vicinity of Mt. Arī<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>ā, where some say the Resurrection will take place. <i>Sāhirah,</i> here translated <i>wide expanse,</i> could also mean that they are “awake” due to the intensity of their fear (R, Z).</p>
079/015: Hast thou heard tell of Moses,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>25</span><span class="hide">  </span>For the full Quranic account of Moses, see 7:103<span class="HCSQ">–</span>55; 10:75<span class="HCSQ">–</span>93; 17:101<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4; 20:9<span class="HCSQ">–</span>97; 26:10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>66; 27:7<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14; 28:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>46; 40:23<span class="HCSQ">–</span>45; 43:46<span class="HCSQ">–</span>56; 44:17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>31. This is most likely the first account of Moses in the chronological order of revelation. As it occurred early in the Makkan period, it would appear to assume some basic knowledge of the story of Moses among the Arabs. Here it is offered as an example for the Prophet and his followers of what will eventually become of unjust rulers, like those of Makkah.</p>

079/023: Then he gathered and proclaimed,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">23</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most say this verse indicates that Pharaoh gathered all the people to declare his sovereignty.

079/025: So God seized him with a punishment exemplary in the Hereafter and in this world.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">25</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>A punishment exemplary</i> renders <i>nakāl,</i> which also indicates weakness and inability, evoking the sense that God rendered Pharaoh impotent in opposing Moses. As translated, this verse is a reference to punishment in this world and the next, and many interpret the this-worldly punishment as the plagues sent upon his people and their drowning in the sea (cf. 20:78<span class="HCSQ">–</span>79; 7:135<span class="HCSQ">–</span>37). Some read this verse as “the punishment of the last and the first,” saying “the first” indicates the punishment for saying, <i>I know of no god for you other than myself,</i> and that “the last” is for saying, <i>I am your lord most high</i> (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s); others say “the first” is for denying Moses and “the last” is for saying, <i>I am your lord most high</i> (Q). In a well-known Sufi interpretation, Alā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span> al-Dawlā al-Simnānī (d. 787/1336) is said to have seen the soul of the famous Sufi martyr al-<span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>allāj in an exalted state.

079/033: as sustenance for you and for your flocks.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">33</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 80:32. God sustains all things and has made all things subservient to human beings (see 22:65; 31:20; 45:13). Human beings are thus God’s vicegerents (see, e.g., 2:30; 6:165c; 35:39) and must remain thankful to God for sustenance, while sharing these resources with all of God’s creatures.</p>
079/034: So when the Great Calamity befalls<span class="HCSQ">—</span><p class="indent"><span class="red1">34</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Calamity</i> translates <i><span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>āmmah,</i> which derives from the verb <i><span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>amma,</i> meaning “to be abundant” or “to rise over,” as would a flood, implying that the <i><span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>āmmah</i> is the greatest of all tremendous events, because its overabundance encompasses all things. Some take <i>the Great Calamity</i> as a reference to the second cry of the trumpet (see 39:68c), at which all human beings and jinn are gathered; others take it as a reference to the Resurrection, because it surpasses and predominates over (<i>ya<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>immu</i>) all things (Q). It is also interpreted by some as a reference to the very moment when the people of Hell are led to Hell and the people of Paradise are led to Paradise. Some view the omission of a response to the conditional <i>when</i> (<i>idhā</i>) as an affirmation that what is to occur must occur (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>

God has kept account of it while they have forgotten it</i> (see also 10:21; 34:3; 36:12; 43:80; 45:29; 78:29; 99:6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8).</p>

Others argue that it could not refer to the disbelievers, because the realities of the Hereafter can only be seen by those who have eyes, and the eyes of the disbelievers are covered (see 2:7; R).</p>
079/037: as for one who rebels

079/039: truly Hellfire is the refuge.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">37<span class="HCSQ">–</span>39</span><span class="hide">  </span>Al-Rāzī interprets <i>one who rebels</i> to indicate corruption of the intellect, for all who know God know their own insignificance and would thus not incline to rebellion and arrogance. <i>Prefers the life of this world</i> is then taken to indicate corruption in actions in accordance with the <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> “The love of the world is the source of all error” (R). The two together are thus taken to indicate the greatest degree of corruption, the punishment for which is eternal. So <i>Hellfire is the refuge</i> for those who reach this level of corruption. Those who do not may still be punished, but Hellfire will not be their ultimate <i>refuge</i> (R). Many verses condemn those who prefer the life of this world over the life of the Hereafter, for <i>the life of this world is naught but the enjoyment of delusion</i> (3:185; 57:20), <i>while the Hereafter is better and more enduring</i> (87:17; cf., e.g., 6:32; 9:38; 14:3).</p>
079/040: As for one who fears standing before his Lord and forbids the soul from caprice,
079/041: truly the Garden is the refuge.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">40<span class="HCSQ">–</span>41</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 55:46: <i>And for one who fears standing before his Lord, there are two Gardens. <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1473" title="1473"/>Maqāma rabbihi,</i> translated <i>standing before his Lord</i> here and in 55:46, could also be translated, “the station of his Lord.” It indicates being aware of standing before God on the Day of Judgment and answering for all of one’s deeds. Al-Rāzī sees this fear of <i>standing before his Lord</i> as the exact opposite of <i>one who rebelled</i> in v. 37, for just as rebellion implies ignorance, fear implies knowledge, as in 35:28: <i>Only those among His servants who know fear God</i>. In the same way, one who <i>forbids the soul from caprice</i> is the opposite of one who <i>prefers the life of this world,</i> for just as rebellion is seen as connected to love of the world, the fear of God is seen as leading the soul to perform acts of obedience and good deeds. From a Quranic perspective, it is caprice that leads astray; one follows either God and His Messenger or caprice. For a discussion of the significance of <i>caprice,</i> see 45:23c.</p>
079/042: They ask thee about the Hour, “When shall it set in?”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">42</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is said to refer to the idolaters of Makkah, who did not ask in order to be informed, but only to mock (Āl, Q). <i>When shall it set in?</i> (cf. 7:187) derives from a nautical metaphor meaning, “When shall it berth?” Some take the use of this metaphor to imply that it is near at hand (Q).</p>
079/043: What hast thou to do with mentioning it?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">43</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be understood either as God’s telling the Prophet that he is not to speak of that of which he does not know, or as a reference to those who contended that the Prophet had no business mentioning the Hour, its signs, the Resurrection, and other things, if he did not know when they were to transpire. The former interpretation is supported by a report from <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>ishah that the Prophet wanted to ask God about the moment when the Hour would come, and God said to him that he was asking for knowledge of something he had no right to know.</p>
079/044: Unto thy Lord is [knowledge of] the end thereof.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">44</span><span class="hide">  </span>Only God knows about the Hour, as in 7:187: <i>They question thee about the Hour, when it will set in. Say, “Knowledge thereof lies only with my Lord. None save He shall manifest it at its proper time. Heavy shall it weigh upon the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but suddenly.” They question thee as if thou knew it well. Say, “Knowledge thereof lies only with God, but most of mankind know not”</i> (cf. 30:34). Thus when the Prophet was asked about the Hour by the Archangel Gabriel, he responded, “Regarding that the one questioned knows no more than the questioner” (IK).</p>
079/045: Thou art but a warner for whosoever fears it.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">45</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 36:11. The Prophet has no knowledge of the Hour and other aspects of the Unseen (see 38:69<span class="HCSQ">–</span>70c), for he is only sent to warn (13:7; 22:49; 27:92; 29:50; 34:46; 35:23; 38:70; 46:9; 67:26). That prophets warn and bring glad tidings is reiterated throughout the Quran (see, e.g., 18:56), yet human beings often expect them to function as soothsayers or fortune-tellers. Thus in 46:9 the Prophet is instructed: <i>Say, “I am no innovation among the messengers, and I know not what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which has been revealed unto me, and I am naught but a clear warner.”</i></p>
079/046: The Day they see it, it will be as if they had tarried but an evening or the morning thereof.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">46</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 10:45; 17:52; 20:103<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4; 23:112<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14; 30:55; 46:35. Most commentators say that this verse means that the time in the grave will seem short before the Day of Judgment, when all souls are gathered before God upon being resurrected. Others say the implication is that life on earth will seem as if it were only an hour in comparison to the experience of the Hereafter (IK, Q); see also 46:35 and the essay “Death, Dying, and the Afterlife in the Quran.” In this instance, <i>morning</i> (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i>) is said to refer to the time period of the worldly life in the eyes of the people when they see the Hereafter (IK). For the broader meaning of <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā,</i> see the introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 93.</p>

The Prophet is here admonished for turning away from one who sought guidance to others whom he hoped to attract to Islam, since he was not responsible for making people accept religion, only for conveying God’s message and guiding those who accepted it, as in 28:56: <i>Surely thou dost not guide whomsoever thou lovest, but God guides whomsoever He will. And He knows best those who are rightly guided.</i> Other verses tell the Prophet to be patient and to not turn away from those who seek religion, such as 6:52: <i>And drive not away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His Face;</i> and 18:28: <i>Make thy soul patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His Face. Turn not thine eyes away from them, desiring the adornment of the life of this world, nor obeying one whose heart We have made heedless of the remembrance of Us and who follows his caprice and whose affair exceeds the bounds.</i></p><p class="indent"><i>Beyond need</i> (v. 5) translates <i>man istaghnā,</i> which literally means “is self-sufficient” and connotes a view of oneself as “self-sufficient” vis-à-vis God. The fear mentioned in v. 9 is fear of God and the Day of Judgment.</p>
080/011: Nay! Truly it is a reminder<span class="HCSQ">—</span><p class="indent"><span class="red1">11</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 74:54. <i>It</i> can be taken as a reference to the Quran, this particular <i>sūrah,</i> or the exhortation to treat people equitably (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). The verse also indicates that it is only incumbent upon the Prophet to convey God’s message and remind others, not to sway those who oppose the message (see 88:21<span class="HCSQ">–</span>24). For the Quran as Reminder, see 36:69c.</p>
080/012: so let whomsoever will, remember it<span class="HCSQ">—</span><p class="indent"><span class="red1">12</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse could also be translated, “So let whomsoever He wills remember it,” meaning that only those whom God wills will be receptive to the revelation and thus remember (Q), for as 11:114 says of the Quran, <i>This is a reminder for those who remember</i>. In either reading, <i>remember it</i> could also be rendered “remember Him,” meaning “remember God” (IK). This latter reading may <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1476" title="1476"/>be more accurate, as the pronoun taken as a reference to the Quran or the <i>sūrah</i> in v. 11 is feminine, while the pronoun rendered “it” or “Him” in v. 12 is masculine.</p>
080/013: on pages honored,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">13</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, <i>pages</i> refers only to the Quran. According to others, it refers to the books of all the prophets (Q) or to the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> (85:22; <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), which is said to be the source of all revelation. <i>Pages</i> translates <i><span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>uf</i> in accordance with the first interpretation. <i><span class="HCSQIt">Ṣ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>uf</i> is also rendered <i>scriptures</i> in 53:36 and 87:18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19, where it refers to the revelations given to Abraham and Moses.

080/014: exalted and purified,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Exalted</i> means “elevated” in the Eyes of God (Aj) and beyond all obscurity and contradiction (Q). <i>Purified</i> means free from any additions or deficiencies (IK) and protected from being assailed by disbelievers (Q), such that <i>None touch it, save those made pure</i> (56:79).</p>

A famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “One who recites the Quran proficiently and has memorized it is with the <i>scribes, noble and pious</i>” (IK). Some argue that here <i>scribes</i> should be “mediators” to indicate the function of mediating God’s message that human beings can fulfill for other human beings (Q). <i>Safara</i> can also mean “to unveil”; thus some take it as an allusion to the Quran’s making matters clear (Q). Others say that <i>the hands of scribes</i> refers to the reciters of the Quran (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
080/017: May man perish! How ungrateful is he!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>May man perish</i> translates <i>qutila al-insān,</i> which could also be rendered, “May man be cursed” (IK, Q). Here the phrase is said to refer to those who deny the truth without any supporting argument, but only because they lack knowledge of it and think it is far-fetched (IK). <i>Ungrateful</i> translates <i>afkara,</i> which indicates both ingratitude toward and disbelief in God (for the broader meaning of <i>kufr,</i> or “disbelief,” see 2:85<span class="HCSQ">–</span>86c). Thus this verse could also be read, “Man is accursed for what he disbelieves,” or “Mankind is accursed; for what does he disbelieve?” (Q). According to some, this verse relates to a specific individual who had accepted Islam, but apostatized when <i>Sūrah</i> 53 was revealed; so God revealed this verse, meaning that he was accursed for disbelieving in the Quran after first believing (Q).</p>

080/019: From a drop He created him, then proportioned him,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19</span><span class="hide">  </span>This is one of several passages in which the creation of the human being from a drop is cited as evidence of God’s Omnipotence, as in 18:37: <i>Do you disbelieve in the One Who created you from dust, then from a drop, then fashioned you as a man?</i> See also 16:4; 40:67; 86:6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8.</p>
080/020: then He made the way easy for him.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">20</span><span class="hide">  </span>From one perspective, this verse refers to the ease with which a baby comes forth from the mother’s womb (IK, Q); from another, it refers to God’s providing all people with guidance, as in 76:3: <i>Truly We guided him upon the way, be he grateful or ungrateful</i> (IK). Some interpret it as an indication that God has made it easy for everything to perform the function for which it was created, as in a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “Work, for that for which each person was created has been made easy for him” (Q).</p>

080/023: Nay!

The emphatic particle <i>kallā</i> (<i>nay</i>) can also be read in the affirmative, in which case the verse would begin, “Truly, he has not . . .” (Q), and would not convey the same sense of rebuke.</p>
080/024: So let man consider his food,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">24</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Consider his food</i> is taken by some to indicate another of the many signs upon which human beings should reflect in order to appreciate fully God’s Power and Mercy (Q).

080/038: Faces that Day shall be shining, radiant,
080/039: laughing, joyous.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">38<span class="HCSQ">–</span>39</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 75:22.

The faces of believers are <i>shining, radiant</i> from the joy they experience in their hearts and the glad tidings manifest on their faces (IK), because of the ablutions they performed in this life (Q, R), <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1478" title="1478"/>their performance of night vigil (Q, R), or their relief from the burdens and attachments of this world (R). The believers are <i>joyous</i> when they receive their reward from God (Q). Related to the event that is said to have occasioned the revelation of this <i>sūrah</i> (see the introduction to the <i>sūrah</i>), these verses can be seen as a reference to the state of Ibn Umm Maktūm, while vv. 40<span class="HCSQ">–</span>42 refer to the state of <i>him who deems himself beyond need</i> (v. 5).</p>
080/040: And faces that Day shall be covered with dust,

According to some, <i>the disbelievers, the profligates</i> indicates the same group; disbelief defines their thoughts, and profligacy their actions (Āl, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b); the punishment for disbelief is <i>faces covered with dust,</i> and the punishment for profligacy is being <i>overspread with darkness</i> (Āl); cf. 75:24.</p>


081/001: When the sun is enfolded,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Enfolded</i> translates <i>kuwwirat,</i> which may be interpreted in various ways: it may mean that the sun is absorbed into the Divine Throne (Q), that the light of the sun is wiped out (IK, Q), or that one part of it will be folded into another and then it will be rolled up and thrown away (IK). In this vein a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “The sun and the moon will be rolled up (<i>kuwwirat</i>) on the Day of Resurrection” (IK).</p>
081/002: and when the stars fade away;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 77:8. <i>Fade away</i> translates <i>inkadarat,</i> which could also mean to spill out, as a container spills out when it is broken (IK, Q), or to fall upon the ground (Q).</p>
081/003: when the mountains are set in motion,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 78:20. Elsewhere it is said that <i>mountains are scattered</i> (77:10), for the Day of Judgment is a day when <i>the mountains are as carded wool</i> (70:9; 101:5) or <i>like heaps of shifting sand</i> (73:14); see also 18:47; 19:90; 20:105<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6; 27:88; 52:10; 56:5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6; 69:14.</p>

Camels were central to Arabian livelihood, and a pregnant camel was doubly valuable. Abandoning a pregnant camel would thus have been a salient metaphor for the Arabs of the time, indicating that on the Day of Judgment people will be so preoccupied with their immediate state that they will have no concern for wealth, even their most precious property, or for the things of this world in general.</p>
081/005: when the wild beasts are gathered,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is seen by most commentators as a reference to the gathering together of all created animals, other than jinn and human beings, after resurrection, even flies (IK, Q). It is said by many that God resurrects all of the animals and allows each of them to claim justice, so that those who had been wronged may retaliate against the offenders; then they all become dust (JJ, Q). For the resurrection of animals, see 6:38c. This verse could also be seen as another example of an apocalyptic inversion of the created order, since <i>wild beasts</i> (<i>wu<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ush</i>) cannot be gathered in this world, but are gathered in the Hereafter.</p>
081/006: and when the seas are made to swell over;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 52:6. That the seas <i>are made to swell over</i> implies another apocalyptic inversion, in which the seas break the <i>barrier which they transgress not</i> (55:20), so that the sweet water mixes with the salty, becoming one (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), and so that they burst forth (82:3), covering the earth or parts of it when the earth quakes. For the significance of the <i>two seas, one sweet, satisfying, the other salty, bitter</i> (25:53), see 25:53c; 35:12c; 55:19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>20c. <i>Made to swell over</i> translates <i>sujjirat,</i> which could also mean “to be set on fire” and is treated in this way by several early commentators (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
081/007: when the souls are coupled,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some say that this verse means when the souls and bodies are joined together on the Day of Judgment (Q). Others maintain that it indicates that the souls of believers are <i>coupled</i> with <i>wide-eyed maidens,</i> as in 44:54 and 52:20, <i>And We shall wed them to wide-eyed maidens</i> (<i>coupled</i> and <i>wed</i> translate the same verb, <i>zawwaja</i>), while the souls of disbelievers and hypocrites are joined to satans, as in 43:36, <i>We assign to him a satan who is then a companion unto him</i>. Others maintain that it indicates souls being joined with like souls, as this is the <i>Day of Division</i> (e.g., 37:21), on which God sorts the righteous from the evil and believers from disbelievers (Q), and they are no longer mixed together as they are in this world. The last interpretation seems to be the most consistent, as a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says of this verse, “Every man will be joined to every person <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1481" title="1481"/>who did as he did” (Āl, IK, Q). In making this connection several commentaries refer to <i>Sūrah</i> 56, which speaks of the division of human beings into three categories: <i>the companions of the left, the companions of the right,</i> and <i>the foremost;</i> see commentary on 56:7<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10.</p>

081/009: for what sin she was slain;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses allude to the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of burying newly born females alive. Although the verses specifically reproach those who engaged in this practice, they can also be read as indicating that all who have been wronged in this world will have the opportunity to demand justice of their oppressors and be vindicated in this life or the next.</p>
081/010: when the pages are spread,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>When the pages are spread</i> refers to the opening of the book in which people’s deeds are recorded. Upon witnessing this life review, they will say, <i>“What a book this is! It leaves out nothing, small or great, save that it has taken account thereof.” And they find present [therein] whatsoever they did</i> (18:49), since on the Day of Judgment no deed can be hidden. For the book in which deeds are recorded, see 17:71c; 18:49c; 50:17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>18; 69:19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>29; 82:11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12.</p>

A well-known <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “There is none among you, but that God will inform him of that which is between him and his two translators [i.e., the two angels who record his deeds; see 50:17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>18c]” (Q).</p>

081/018: and by the morning as it breathes!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18</span><span class="hide">  </span>The image of the <i>morning as it breathes</i> alludes to both the manner in which the morning appears to awaken from the night and the way its light expands and spreads like exhaled breath until it becomes day (Āl). If v. 17 is taken as the approach of night, this verse is interpreted to mean “by the morning as it rises” (IK), alluding to the beginning of the morning. When v. 17 is taken as the receding of the night, this verse is understood to indicate either the rising of the morning or the gradual illumination of the day.</p>
081/019: Truly it is the speech of a noble messenger,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">19</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is the response to the oath by which God swears in vv. 15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>18. <i>It</i> is a reference to <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1482" title="1482"/>the Quran. A <i>noble messenger</i> is taken by most as a reference to the Archangel Gabriel, though some take it as a reference to the Prophet (Q). The verse is repeated in 69:40.</p>
081/020: possessed of strength, before the Possessor of the Throne, of high rank,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">20</span><span class="hide">  </span>If v. 19 is seen as a reference to the Archangel Gabriel, <i>possessed of strength</i> would be similar to <i>one of awesome power,</i> which describes Gabriel in 53:5 (Z). Gabriel’s <i>strength</i> can be taken to mean his ability to withstand all forces from this earth, as he is said to have overcome the armies from the cities of Lot, or his steadfastness in being completely obedient to God from the beginning of creation until the end of time (Āl, Q). If v. 19 is understood as a reference to the Prophet, <i>possessed of strength</i> is taken to mean his ability to deliver God’s message (Q). For <i>Possessor of the Throne,</i> see 17:42; 40:15; 85:15. God is also described as <i>Lord of the Throne</i> (9:129; 21:22; 23:86; 23:116; 27:26; 43:82), which is borne by angels (40:7; 69:17).</p>
081/021: obeyed, trustworthy withal.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">21</span><span class="hide">  </span>When vv. 19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>20 are taken as a reference to Gabriel, <i>obeyed</i> refers to his position among other angels. When taken as a reference to the Prophet, it refers to the injunction for those who obey God to obey His Messenger (see 3:32; 4:59; 5:92; 24:54<span class="HCSQ">–</span>56; 47:33; 64:12). <i>Trustworthy</i> translates <i>amīn,</i> which could also be rendered “faithful” or “secure,” and is understood to mean that the Prophet is faithful to the revelation and message with which he has been entrusted, delivering it as instructed by God. <i>Al-Amīn,</i> “the Trustworthy,” was one of the names by which the Prophet was known even before the advent of the revelation.</p>
081/022: Your companion is not possessed.
081/023: He surely saw him upon the clear horizon.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">22<span class="HCSQ">–</span>23</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, the Prophet had sought a vision of the Archangel Gabriel in his true form, and when he saw him upon the horizon with six hundred wings, he fell down prostrate, covering himself. So the idolaters of Makkah said that he was possessed by a jinn (<i>majnūn</i>) or that he was mad, and vv. 20<span class="HCSQ">–</span>23 were revealed in response (Q). <i>The clear horizon</i> is understood by some as a specific reference to the east as the place where the sun rises (Q, R), or as a reference to 53:7, which says that Gabriel was <i>upon the highest horizon</i> during the Night Journey and Ascension (see 17:1c; introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 53). The verse could also be rendered, “The one who makes clear saw him upon the horizon,” a reading preferred by several scholars when v. 24 is read as describing the Prophet (Q).</p>
081/024: And he does not withhold grudgingly the Unseen.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">24</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most take <i>he</i> in this verse as a reference to the Prophet; others as a reference to the Archangel Gabriel. In both cases it means that he teaches the Quran and the rulings (<i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>kām</i>) of God that he has been instructed to teach, withholding nothing. Many prefer an alternate reading, in which the word translated <i>withhold grudgingly, <span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>anīn,</i> is read as <i><span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>anīn,</i> meaning “suspect, unreliable, or untrustworthy” (Āl, Q, R), meaning, “he is not unreliable with regard to the Unseen.”</p>
081/025: Nor is it the speech of a satan outcast.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">25</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is a response to those who are reported to have said that the Quran was inspired by Satan and that the Prophet was a sorcerer (R), an accusation made against other prophets as well (see 38:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5; 51:52).</p>
081/026: So where are you going?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">26</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse asks essentially, “Where will you, who do not follow God and His Messenger, turn, for none guides but God?”</p>
081/027: It is naught but a reminder for the worlds,

As translated, v. 27 refers to the Quran. It could also be rendered as a reference to the Prophet Muhammad: “He is naught but a reminder,” as in 88:21: <i>Thou art but a reminder</i>. But it most likely refers to the Quran, as the Quran and previous revelations are referred to as reminders in many verses (e.g., 6:90; 15:9; <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1483" title="1483"/>16:44). That it is a reminder <i>for the worlds</i> is taken to indicate that it is a universal revelation for any people who desire guidance (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b).</p><p class="indent">For whosoever wishes <i>to go straight,</i> the Quran and the Prophet will serve as a reminder, but for those who do not, <i>He misleads many by it</i> (i.e., the Quran; 2:26). These verses are taken to indicate that the act of traveling the straight path is dependent upon one’s will and desire to do so (R). Yet none will to follow the straight path unless God wills that they will it, for the manifestation of desire within human beings is determined by God’s Desire (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b). From this perspective, one’s will and desire to follow the path is a manifestation of God’s Will and Desire within; for more on the relation between human choice and Divine determinism, see 54:49c.</p>

According to some, <i>what it has sent forth</i> indicates the good deeds done in obedience to God and observance of His Commands, and <i>what it has left behind</i> indicates those deeds that, although commanded, were left undone (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Others say this verse indicates all the good and evil that individuals have <i>sent forth,</i> or done, in accord with which they will be judged, and all the good and evil that was <i>left behind,</i> that they could have done during this life, but did not (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Al-<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>abarī, however, maintains that a deed is not something that can be <i>left behind</i> unless it has actually been performed, so that <i>what it has left behind</i> indicates “a good or evil practice that one has established such that if another performs it he [the one who established it] has the same reward as the one who performed it or the same burden” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>

082/007: Who created you, then fashioned you, then proportioned you,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Fashioned you</i> refers to the manner in which God has made all human parts and faculties sound and functional (R). <i>Proportioned you</i> translates <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>addalaka,</i> which could also be read <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>adalaka,</i> meaning “turned you,” implying that God turns people in any direction He wills. Both readings are viable, though the former is grammatically more appropriate when v. 8 is read as a continuation of v. 7 (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
082/008: assembling you in whatever form He willed?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some take this verse to indicate the manner in which God chooses a particular human form for each individual (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).

According to Abū Hurayrah, these verses refer directly to a man who had two scales, one that he used when buying and another for selling (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). It is reported that when these verses were revealed, the Prophet recited them to the citizens of Madinah and said, “Five for five.” He was asked, “What is ‘Five for five’?” He answered, “No people broke their covenant, but that God set their enemies over them. None judged by other than what God sent down, but that poverty spread among them. None fornicated, but that death spread among them. None defrauded, but that their crops failed and they were plagued by famine. No community refused to pay alms, but that God withheld rain from them” (Q, R). These verses can also be extended beyond their immediate context to imply that shame and suffering will befall anyone who intentionally falls short in any matter according to what has been ordained by God. With regard to prayer, it is reported that Ibn Mas<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>ūd, a Companion of the Prophet and early Quranic commentator, said, “Prayer is a measure. Whosoever completes [its measure] God will complete [his reward] for him.

Other narrations say, “People will stand in their perspiration up to the middle of their ears” (Bg, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).

Some interpret <i>Sijjīn</i> as a reference to a place where disbelievers are held until the Day of Judgment; most say it refers to the lowest depths of Hellfire and relate the <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth:</i> “<i>Sijjīn</i> is the lowest of the seven earths” (IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Some relate it to the <i>lowest of the low</i> (95:5), unto which God is said to have cast <i>man,</i> and to the <i>narrow place</i> (25:13) into which the disbelievers are to be cast (IK). Others interpret it as a characterization of the book in which evil deeds are indelibly recorded (Q, Qu, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s, Z).</p>
083/009: A book inscribed.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Inscribed</i> here means “sealed” (Q, R), as what is written cannot be decreased or erased (IK, Q, R).

Some say that this verse describes <i>Sijjīn</i> (R), but most agree that it describes <i>the book of the profligate,</i> not <i>Sijjīn</i> itself (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s, Z).</p>

083/014: Nay!

If he repents from it, his heart is polished clean. But if he increases [in sin], the spot will continue to increase. That is the statement of God, <i>Nay! But that which they used to earn has covered their hearts with rust</i>” (IK, Q). Some commentators say that this verse refers to inveterate sinners for whom sin upon sin has sealed their hearts from realizing the truth (Q, R), like one <i>surrounded by his sins</i> (2:81). According to the Prophet, the heart covered with rust must be “polished.” As he says in a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “For everything there is a polish, and the polish for the heart is the remembrance of God. There is nothing more potent in saving a person from the Punishment of God than the remembrance of God.” It was asked, “Not even striving (<i>jihād</i>) in the path of God?” Then he replied, “Not even if you were to continue striking with your sword until it breaks.”</p>
083/015: Nay!

Many relate this to the belief that after the gathering of all human beings and jinn before God (see, e.g., 3:25; 4:87; 6:38, 128; 42:7; 64:9), the believers will see God, but the disbelievers will not (R). In this vein, the famous Persian Sufi poet Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī writes, “Everyone sees the Unseen in proportion to the clarity of his heart, and that depends upon how much he has polished it. Whoever has polished it more sees more<span class="HCSQ">—</span>more Unseen forms become manifest to him”(<i>Mathnawī,</i> 4:2909<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10).</p>

Contrasted with <i>Sijjīn</i> in v. 7, it appears to refer to a place in Heaven in which good deeds are indelibly recorded. The fifth Shiite Imam, Muhammad al-Bāqir, is reported to have said, “<i>Sijjīn</i> is the seventh earth, and <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>Illiyyūn</i> is the seventh heaven.” Opinions differ. <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>Illiyyūn</i> is either in the seventh heaven below the Divine Throne or beyond the seven heavens to the right of the Throne (Q); it indicates heights without limit (Q) or refers to the <i>lote tree of the boundary</i> (53:14).</p>

The pious are <i>gazing</i> at the delights they are given in the Garden (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), or at God Himself (Q, R), as in 75:22<span class="HCSQ">–</span>23: <i>Faces that Day shall be radiant, gazing upon their Lord.</i> Some commentators say they gaze upon the punishment endured by their enemies (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s; see vv. 34<span class="HCSQ">–</span>35), though this interpretation is not consonant with the sayings of the Prophet or with other passages of the Quran.</p>
083/024: Thou dost recognize in their faces the splendor of bliss.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">24</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Thou</i> can be read in a general sense as an address to any reader or listener or as a specific reference to the Prophet Muhammad.

083/025: They are given to drink of pure wine sealed,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">25</span><span class="hide">  </span>Those in Paradise drink the <i>pure wine</i> sanctioned by God. It may be the same as the wine in 37:46<span class="HCSQ">–</span>47: <i>White, delicious to those who drink thereof. No headiness lies therein; nor are they intoxicated by it;</i> and 56:19: <i>Wherefrom they suffer neither headache nor stupefaction.</i> Some say that this <i>pure wine</i> is superior to the <i>rivers of wine</i> referred to in 47:15 (R).</p>

083/027: and whose mixture is of Tasnīm,
083/028: a spring whence drink those brought nigh.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>28</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most commentators agree that <i>Tasnīm</i> is the purest and noblest drink of Heaven (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Some say that it flows from the Divine Throne into Paradise. <i>Tasnīm</i> is understood by some as a proper name with no specific meaning (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Others propose that it derives from the verb <i>sannama,</i> “to raise,” indicating that it raises or ennobles those who drink it (R). According to Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās, <i>Tasnīm</i> is what is alluded to in 32:17: <i>No soul knows what comfort is kept hidden for it as a recompense for that which they used to do</i> (R). Some say that <i>Tasnīm</i> is a spring whose waters are mixed with the <i>pure wine sealed</i> for the <i>companions of the right</i> (56:8, 27, 38, 90<span class="HCSQ">–</span>91; 74:39; 90:18), but from which <i>those brought nigh</i> drink in its purest form (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Similarly, others say <i>those brought nigh</i> drink of it unmixed, while all the other inhabitants of Paradise drink of it mixed (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). According to al-Rāzī, <i>Tasnīm</i> “is the knowledge of God and the delight of gazing upon the Face of God.” So <i>those brought nigh</i> drink from none but <i>Tasnīm,</i> for they gaze upon none but God, whereas <i>the companions of the right</i> sometimes gaze upon the delights of the created (though paradisal) world and sometimes upon the Face of God, and thus drink a mixture (R). Some Sufi commentators have identified <i>Tasnīm</i> with the highest level of spiritual love (<i>ma<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>abbah</i>).</p>

083/031: And when they returned to their people, they would return blithely.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">31</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Blithely</i> translates <i>fākihīn,</i> as it is read in most schools of Quranic recitation, though the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1491" title="1491"/>most widespread school of recitation, <span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>af<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span>, reads it as <i>fakihīn,</i> which translates as “conceited” or “proud.”</p>
083/032: And when they saw them, they said, “Truly these are astray!”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">32</span><span class="hide">  </span>The disbelievers deem the believers to be <i>astray</i> for following the Prophet.</p>
083/033: Though they were not sent as guardians over them.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">33</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse implies that the disbelievers are not fit to judge the actions of the believers (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Some gloss <i>guardians</i> (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>āfi<span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>īn</i>) as “witnesses” (<i>shāhidīn</i>), meaning that they arrogate to themselves the ability to bear witness against the believers, but in the Hereafter it is the believers who will bear witness against them (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
083/034: So that Day those who believe shall laugh at those who disbelieve,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">34</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>That Day</i> is the Day of Resurrection.</p>
083/035: upon couches, gazing.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">35</span><span class="hide">  </span>In this context, the implication is that the believers are gazing upon the disbelievers and witnessing the punishment the disbelievers receive for having mocked them (Aj). It can thus be viewed as a contrast to v. 23, or alternatively as a reassertion of the same paradisal state. See 83:23c.</p>
083/036: Have the disbelievers been requited for that which they used to do?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">36</span><span class="hide">  </span>The answer to the question posed by this verse is yes and no. On the one hand, the disbelievers have been requited with punishment for the evil deeds they committed. On the other hand, they have not been requited for what only appear to be good deeds, since <i>they are those whose deeds have come to naught in this world and in the Hereafter</i> (3:22; see also 7:147; 18:104; 47:8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9). From a Quranic perspective, only those deeds that are accompanied by belief in God, His prophets, His revelations, and His angels can truly be called good or righteous. Thus the phrase <i>perform righteous deeds,</i> which occurs over fifty times in the Quran, is always accompanied by some mention of belief in God.</p>



084/001: When the sky is rent asunder,

084/003: and when the earth is stretched out,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>When the earth is stretched out</i> means when all that is upon it is made flat (cf. 20:105<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7). According to some, this is to prepare for the Day of Judgment, when all human beings will be gathered on a single plain (see 18:47; 20:106; 79:14).</p>
084/004: and casts forth what is in it, emptying itself,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse refers to the time when all of the graves are emptied and everyone is brought to Judgment (cf. 79:13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14; 99:2). Some say it means that all that was hidden within it becomes manifest.</p>

Maybudī understands it as an injunction to be mindful, since every moment is a step closer to God.</p>

This verse and others (e.g., 56:27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>46) display the universal identification of the right hand with goodness and light and the left hand (though not mentioned explicitly) with evil and darkness, like the Latin <i>sinister,</i> which means “on the left” and is the origin of the English “sinister.”</p>
084/008: he will be reckoned with an easy reckoning<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>The Prophet said, “Whosoever is reckoned on the Day of Resurrection will be punished.” To which <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>ishah responded, “But has God not said, <i>As for one who is given his book in his right hand, he will be reckoned with an easy reckoning</i>?” The Prophet replied, “That is not the Reckoning; rather, that is the presentation [of deeds]. Whosoever suffers the interrogation of the Reckoning on the Day of Resurrection will be punished” (IK, Q, Z).</p>
084/009: and will return to his people joyful.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>His people</i> (<i>ahlihi</i>) may refer to family if they were believers, a group of similar believers, or companions in Paradise (Z).

084/010: But as for one who is given his book from behind his back,

084/012: and will enter a Blaze.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12</span><span class="hide">  </span>To reconcile v. 10 with 69:25, which states that those who are reckoned are given their book in their <i>left hand,</i> the commentators say that in this instance the left hand will be tied behind the back (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s, Z).</p>
084/013: Truly among his people he was joyful.

Regarding this contrast, a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “The world is the prison of the believer and the garden of the disbeliever” (R).</p>
084/015: Nay! Truly his Lord was watchful of him.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Nay!</i> That is, they will in fact return.

084/016: So I swear by the twilight,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">16</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Twilight</i> (<i>al-shafaq</i>) refers to the remaining redness and light of the sun after its setting at the beginning of the night until it is close to actual nighttime (IK) or the period between the setting of the sun and the last bit of light on the horizon (Q).</p>
084/017: by the night and what it enshrouds,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Enshrouds</i> (<i>tasaqa</i>) conveys the notion of “gathering together (in one herd)” and points to the symbolic power of night, as it gathers all things together by encompassing them in darkness, just as all things will be brought back to God in the end.</p>
084/018: and by the moon when full;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>When full</i> (<i>ittasaqa</i>) derives from the same root as “enshroud” (<i>tasaqa</i>). In relation to v. 19, it can be seen as a reference to the manner in which all that exists waxes and wanes as it goes through various states and phases.</p>
084/019: thou wilt surely journey from stage to stage.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">19</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>From stage to stage</i> is understood by some to indicate the vagaries of human existence, in which we experience “ease after difficulty, difficulty after ease, wealth after poverty, poverty after wealth, health after sickness, and sickness after health” (IK, Q). Yet others say, “<i>From stage to stage:</i> weaned after he was breast-fed, and an old man after he was a young man” (IK). Others understand it as a reference to the many states of being from nonexistence to life to death, then to all posthumous states of being; some say it refers only to the posthumous states of being or merely to states of being on the Day of Resurrection (Q, R, Z; see the essay “Death, Dying, and the Afterlife in the Quran”). It can also be seen as a reference to the exchange of states in which those who are lowly on the earth will be exalted in the Hereafter and those exalted on earth will be brought low (R). This verse is likely an address to the Prophet, as it is in the second-person singular, in which case it is seen as a reference to his moving in degrees of nearness to God (R), or as an allusion to the night of Ascension (<i>mi<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>rāj;</i> see 17:1c; My). In this vein, it is recorded that Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās said of this verse, “That concerns your Prophet.”</p>
084/020: So what ails them that they believe not,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">20</span><span class="hide">  </span>As a continuation of v. 14, this verse asks, “Seeing as all things move through phases of existence whereby they return to God, how could human beings not discern the truth from these signs and not believe in the Resurrection and in God’s Power over all things?” (Q, R).</p>
084/021: and that when the Quran is recited unto them, they do not prostrate?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">21</span><span class="hide">  </span>Here the Quran is invoked as another sign of God, as if to say, “If they cannot read the signs of God in the created world, then they should at least be able to recognize the miracle of the Quran and the signs of God contained in it.” According to some, <i>prostrate</i> (<i>yasjudūn</i>) refers to prayer. Others say it refers to humility. Most maintain that this is one of fifteen verses after which one prostrates when reciting the Quran; see 19:58c. Imam Mālik does not maintain that one is obligated to prostrate after reciting this verse, but other Mālikī jurists do (Q).</p>
084/022: Nay! Those who disbelieve deny.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">22</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some are inveterate; so no matter whether they see signs that appeal to intelligence or miracles such as the Quran, they will not believe.</p>
084/023: But God knows best what they conceal.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">23</span><span class="hide">  </span>What the disbelievers are concealing within their breasts and hearts is polytheism, whatever its form, and denial (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
084/024: So give them glad tidings of a painful punishment,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">24</span><span class="hide">  </span>Although <i>glad tidings</i> usually indicates the good news of salvation that prophets bring, here as elsewhere (see 3:21; 4:138; 9:3, 34; 45:8), it is used with a sense of irony indicating that hypocrites and disbelievers will receive the <i>painful <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1495" title="1495"/>punishment</i> that they seem to desire. Alternately <i>glad tidings</i> could be read as a reference to the following verse, thus indicating that the door of repentance remains open.</p>
084/025: save those who believe and perform righteous deeds; theirs shall be a reward unceasing.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">25</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 41:8; 95:6. Some say this verse should read, “but those who believe . . .” to distinguish the fate of believers from that of disbelievers (Q, Z). Others say that it should be “save those who . . .” to distinguish the disbelievers who repent from those who do not (Q, R). For the meaning of <i>reward unceasing,</i> see 41:8c; 95:6c.</p>



085/001: By the sky possessed of constellations.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>For <i>constellations</i> (<i>burūj</i>), see 25:61c.

Owing to a lexical relation to <i>tabarruj</i> (“to display one’s beauty”), <i>possessed of constellations</i> (<i>dhāt al-burūj</i>) could also be read “beautiful in its creation” (Q).</p>
085/002: By the Day promised,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The Day</i> is the Day of Resurrection (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s, Z).</p>
085/003: and by the witness and the witnessed.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most commentators interpret <i>witness</i> and <i>witnessed</i> as references to Friday and the Day of <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Arafah, respectively (Bg, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Some see the Prophet Muhammad as <i>the witness,</i> as in 2:143 and 22:78: <i>and that the Messenger may be a witness for you</i> (cf. 4:41; 33:45), and human beings as <i>the witnessed</i> (Bg, Q). Others interpret <i>witness</i> as a reference to the Prophet Muhammad and <i>witnessed</i> as a reference to the Islamic community (<i>ummah</i>), while others prefer the pairing of all of the Divine messengers and their respective communities, as the messengers will bear witness for or against their communities on the Day of Judgment (cf. 4:41; 5:117; Q). Another view sees <i>witness</i> as the Muslim community and <i>witnessed</i> as all other communities, as in 2:143: <i>Thus did we make you a middle community, that you may be witnesses for mankind</i> (cf. 22:78). Others say that <i>witness</i> is human beings and <i>witnessed</i> is God (Q). In another interpretation <i>witness</i> is human beings and <i>witnessed</i> the black stone in the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah that pilgrims touch in bearing witness to their covenant with God (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others take God to be <i>the witness,</i> as in 4:79: <i>God suffices as a Witness;</i> and 6:19: <i>Say, “What thing is greatest as testimony?” Say, “God is Witness between you and me”</i> (Q).</p>
085/004: May they perish, the inhabitants of the pit,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9</span><span class="hide">  </span>Many stories attempt to identify the <i>inhabitants of the pit</i>. Some take it as a reference to the people of Dhū Nuwās al-Yamānī, a Yemeni king who is said to have persecuted the Christians of Yemen in pre-Islamic times (IK). The most frequently cited account in the interpretation of this verse is a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> that relates the story of a king who was enraged that the people recognized God as their Lord and as a lord above him. After he killed a young boy who was foremost among them and the people refused to renounce their religion, he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads. It was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, “Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, cast him into the fire.” So they set about casting people into the fire. Then a woman came with her son, and he said, “Be patient, mother, for truly you are following the truth” (Bg, IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Most say that the religion of those persecuted was Christianity; others say they were Magians (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s); still others say it could refer to one of the messengers not mentioned in the Quran (Bg). Although these verses are believed to pertain to a particular historical incident, they present a universal condemnation of all who persecute believers of any faith.</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>Another reading is, “Slain were the inhabitants of the pit.”</p>
085/005: the fire well fueled,

085/007: and were witness to what they did unto the believers,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can refer to either the presence of the disbelievers at the burning of the believers or their bearing witness against themselves on the Day of Judgment, as in 24:24; 36:65; 41:20.</p>
085/008: and took vengeance on them for naught but that they believed in God, the Mighty, the Praised,

Some say <i>the punishment of Hell</i> is for their disbelieving and <i>the punishment of burning</i> is for persecuting others (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
085/011: Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds, theirs shall be Gardens with rivers running below: that is the supreme triumph.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The supreme triumph</i> (<i>al-fawz al-kabīr</i>) most likely refers to Paradise, similar to <i>the great triumph</i> (<i>al-fawz al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>īm</i>), which commentators usually identify as a reference to <i>the Garden,</i> indicating that it is greater than any triumph one can attain in this world (Al).

Surely His seizing is painful, severe</i> (R). Some interpret this verse as the response to the oath begun in v. 1, with what lies between constituting an affirmation of the oath (Q).</p>

085/016: Doer of whatsoever He will.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">16</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 22:18: <i>Truly God does whatsoever He will</i>. One of the basic themes of the Quran is that God is Omnipotent and His Will is supreme, as in 5:17: <i>Unto God belongs sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them. He creates whatsoever He will, and God is Powerful over all things</i> (cf. 24:45; 30:54).</p>

Pharaoh provides an older example from the Biblical tradition, and the Thamūd would have likely been a more resonant example for the Arabs. These examples show that the situation faced by the Muslims is the same as the one all believers face and that the Muslims, like those who were oppressed before them, will prevail (R), whether in this life or the next. For the Quranic account of <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1499" title="1499"/>Pharaoh, see 7:103<span class="HCSQ">–</span>41; 20:24<span class="HCSQ">–</span>79.

085/022: upon a Preserved Tablet.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">21<span class="HCSQ">–</span>22</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, <i>glorious</i> (<i>majīd</i>) indicates the utmost in nobility, magnanimity, and grace (Q). Others say that it indicates the uncreatedness of the Quran (Q). In light of 15:9, <i>Truly it is We Who have sent down the Reminder, and surely We are its Preserver,</i> the present verses are understood to indicate that the Quran is guarded by God from any increase, decrease, distortion, or change (IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s,).</p><p class="indent">Some say that the <i>Book concealed</i> (56:78) and the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> are the same (R). Others say that the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> refers to a book recited by the angels nigh unto God (Aj, Q, R), while others relate it to <i>the Mother of the Book</i> (3:7; 13:39; 43:4), said to be the source of all revelation, from which the Quran and all other revealed Books are derived (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Some commentators describe the <i>Tablet</i> (<i>law<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span></i>) as one made of white pearls that is as high as the distance between Heaven and earth and as wide as the distance between the east and the west (JJ, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others say that it is located to the right of God’s Throne (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). In keeping with the predominant theme of the <i>sūrah,</i> believers prevailing over persecution from disbelievers, al-Qushayrī relates the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> to 29:49, <i>Nay, it is but clear signs in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge,</i> indicating that the Quran is preserved in the hearts of true believers. For further discussion of the <i>Preserved Tablet,</i> see the essay “The Quran and Schools of Islamic Theology and Philosophy.”</p>



086/001: By the sky and that which comes by night.
086/002: And what will apprise thee of that which comes by night?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>That which comes by night</i> refers to either a specific star or all heavenly bodies that appear at night and disappear during the day (Bq).</p>
086/003: It is the piercing star.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most say the <i>piercing star</i> refers to the Pleiades. Others say that it is Saturn, Venus, or a meteor. A minority say that it can be any star that glitters (Āl). In each interpretation the star is called upon because it pierces the dark (Āl) and in this sense can be seen as an allusion to overcoming ignorance (Bq).</p>
086/004: Over every soul there is a guardian.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>A guardian</i> refers to the angels who are said to be tasked with recording the deeds of individual human beings (cf. 40:80; 50:18; 82:10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12) or to the angels who protect human beings at all times (cf. 6:61; 13:11), though the protection here may be specifically against the whispers of Satan and jinn referred to in 114:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6.</p>
086/005: So let man consider that from which he was created.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>Let those who deny the Resurrection reflect upon the manner in which God created them (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). This verse can also be understood as a call to recognize that for which the human being was created, as in 51:56: <i>I did not create jinn and mankind, save to worship Me.</i> In this vein, Maybudī writes: “God created a face fit for prostration, eyes fit for taking heed, a body fit for service, a heart fit for knowledge (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>irfān</i>), and a secret core fit for love. So <i>remember God’s Blessing upon you</i> [2:231], for He adorned your tongues with the <i>shahādah,</i> your hearts with knowledge (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>irfān</i>) and joy, and your bodies with service and worship.”</p>
086/006: He was created from a gushing fluid,

086/008: Truly He is able to bring him back,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>As in 19:67 and 22:5, here the Quran argues that if God is able to create human beings <i>from dust, then from a drop</i> (35:11), then He can surely resurrect them, as in 30:27: <i>He it is Who originates creation, then brings it back, and that is most easy for Him.</i> Many pre-Islamic Arabs accepted that God was the Creator, but did not accept that He could resurrect the dead (see 18:37; 19:67<span class="HCSQ">–</span>73; 22:5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6c; 23:13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16; 35:11; 40:67; 76:2; 80:18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>22).</p>
086/009: on the Day when secrets are tested,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Secrets</i> refers to all that is hidden in the heart and mind and to all of one’s deeds (Z). People’s mouths, feet, hands (36:65), and even their skin (41:19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>24) will bear witness to what they have done. It is related that Mu<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>ādh ibn Jabal asked the Prophet, “What are these secrets for which the servants [i.e., human beings] will be tested in the Hereafter?” To which he replied, “Your secrets are your deeds, such as prayer, fasting, the alms, the minor ablution, the major ablution, and all other obligatory acts. All deeds are hidden secrets. For if a person wills, he says, ‘I have prayed,’ though he has not prayed. And if he wills, he says, ‘I have made my ablution,’ though he has not made his ablution. And this is God’s Word (<i>qawl</i>), <i>on the Day when secrets are tested</i>” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
086/010: whereat man has neither strength nor helper.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse echoes others in which God is spoken of as the sole helper or protector (see, e.g., 2:107, 120; 9:74, 116; 33:18, 65; 42:31; 48:22), and none shall avail another against God’s Punishment (2:48, 123; 3:10, 116; 26:88; 31:33; 44:41).</p>
086/011: By the resurgent sky,
086/012: and by the furrowed earth,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses refer to the cycles of the seasons and the growing of vegetation as signs <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1502" title="1502"/>that God can resurrect as He wills, just as vv. 6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8 cited human beings’ emergence from a base fluid. In reference to heaven, “resurgent” (<i>raj<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span></i>) refers to the rains that return periodically. Thus most interpret <i>the resurgent sky</i> as a reference to rain or to the clouds that bring rain (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others interpret it as a reference to the continual return of the sun, the moon, and other celestial bodies (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). The <i>furrowed earth</i> is where the vegetation emerges.</p>
086/013: truly it is indeed a decisive Word.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">13</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>A decisive Word</i> refers to either the Quran or the Day of Judgment, both of which separate good from evil in a decisive manner. The Prophet said of the Quran, “It is a statement that separates right from wrong” (Āl). See 37:21; 44:40; 77:13, 38; 78:17, where the Day of Judgment is referred to as <i>the Day of Division</i> between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, light and dark.</p>
086/014: And it is not for amusement.
086/015: Truly they are devising a scheme,
086/016: and I, too, am devising a scheme.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16</span><span class="hide">  </span>Here the disbelievers among the Quraysh are likened to those who schemed against previous prophets, such as Joseph, Moses, and Hūd. But as 8:18 says, <i>God makes feeble the scheming of the disbelievers,</i> since <i>God is swifter in plotting</i> (10:21). And although God’s <i>scheme is firm</i> (7:183; 68:45), those who are guilty <i>only plot against themselves, though they are unaware</i> (6:123). Thus 16:127 counsels the Prophet, <i>Grieve not on their account, nor be distressed by what they plot</i> (see also 52:46; 77:39).</p>
086/017: So be gentle with the disbelievers; grant them respite for a while.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Grant them respite</i> indicates that one should not seek to hasten the Hour, as do the disbelievers (see 8:32; 42:18c), because God will deal with them in due time (see 31:24). Some say that the implication that God will deal with them refers to the Battle of Badr in 2/624, when the Makkans were defeated by the Muslims; others say that it refers to the Day of Resurrection, on which all will be judged (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). The verse can be seen as alluding to punishment in both this world and the Hereafter, but also to mercy insofar as God allows people time to repent.</p>



087/001: Glorify the Name of thy Lord, the Most High,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Regarding the relationship between the different ways in which God is glorified in the Quran, see 64:1c. <i>The Most High</i> can be understood to modify <i>Lord</i> or <i>the Name,</i> though most prefer the former (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). When <i>Most High</i> modifies <i>Lord,</i> the verse is simply an injunction to glorify God. When it modifies <i>the Name,</i> the verse is understood to provide instruction regarding the manner in which one should glorify God, meaning that one should refrain from associating the Name of God with any other thing (R) or that one should praise God with the Names that God has revealed, as in 17:110: <i>Call upon God, or call upon the Compassionate</i> (R). It is said that when <i>So glorify the Name of thy Lord, the Magnificent</i> (56:74) was revealed, the Prophet told his Companions, “Enact it when you bow [in prayer],” and when the present verse was revealed, he said, “Enact it when you prostrate” (Q, R). Muslims thus say “Glory be to God, the Magnificent” three times when bowing in prayer and the formula “Glory be to God, the Most High” three times when prostrating.</p>
087/002: Who created, then fashioned,
087/003: Who measured out, then guided,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Here <i>created</i> refers to human beings in particular, to human beings and animals, or to all of creation (R). With regard to the first, God fashioned the first human being after breathing into him of His Spirit, leaving him without irregularities. Then He <i>measured out</i> his form and figure and bestowed the nourishment required for existence (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). <i>Measured out</i> renders <i>qaddara,</i> which can also be read <i>qadara,</i> meaning to have power or to determine, in which case the verse indicates that after God created and fashioned, He maintained direct power over all that He created (R).</p><p class="indent">Here guidance refers to the insinct God puts in all things to be able to seek the nourishment that He has already measured out for them or to the manner in which He guides people to His religion and to knowledge of His Unity by manifesting signs and clear proofs (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). The broader implication is that creation is as it should be, without imperfection or flaw (see 67:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4c).</p>
087/004: and Who brought forth pasture,
087/005: then made it as blackened stubble.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses allude to the manner in which God maintains power over the creation and destruction of all living things. <i>Pasture</i> renders <i>mar<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ā,</i> which refers to all forms of vegetation.</p>
087/006: We shall teach thee to recite, that thou wilt not forget,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is an assurance that God will grant revelation in due time and ensure the Prophet does not forget it. It is reported that when the Archangel Gabriel came, the Prophet would sometimes recite the beginning of the passage being revealed before Gabriel had finished, fearing that he might forget. So this verse was revealed (Bg, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). In 20:114 and 75:16<span class="HCSQ">–</span>17, the Prophet is also counseled not to “hasten” the revelation.</p>
087/007: save what God wills. Truly He knows that which is open and that which is hidden.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>The Prophet is counseled that if a verse has been forgotten, it is because God willed it, not because of a fault on the part of the Prophet (R). Muslims believe that God abrogated some verses and caused others to be “forgotten,” but always replaced them with better verses. For a discussion of abrogation, see commentary on 2:106: <i>No sign do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but that We bring that which is better than it or like unto it;</i> and the essay “The Quran as Source of Islamic Law.”</p>
087/008: And We shall ease thy way unto ease.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some understand this verse as an allusion to the uncomplicated nature of the revealed law (JJ, R). See 2:185: <i>God desires ease for you, and He does not desire hardship for you;</i> and 94:5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6. Others say that in light of vv. 6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7, this verse indicates that God will make it easy for the Prophet to memorize the Quran (R). Others interpret the verse as a reference to God’s easing the way for believers to enter Paradise (R).</p>
087/009: So remind, should the reminder benefit:<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1505" title="1505"/><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse implies that whether it is of benefit or not, all should be reminded of God’s message (Bg), for all will be held accountable.</p>
087/010: he who fears will remember;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>11</span><span class="hide">  </span>Those who are certain of the return to God and those who admit to it but are not certain of it are those who fear God (v. 10), while those who deny the return to God are the <i>most wretched</i> (v. 11; R). In relation to v. 9, these verses imply that the reminder only benefits those who fear God.</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 50:45: <i>So remind, by the means of the Quran, those who fear My Threat.</i></p>
087/011: while the most wretched shall avoid it;
087/012: he who enters into the greatest Fire,
087/013: then neither dies therein nor lives.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">12<span class="HCSQ">–</span>13</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 20:74; 74:28<span class="HCSQ">–</span>29. The “greatest” or “greater” Fire is that of the Hereafter, while the lesser fire is that of this world (JJ, R). Alternately, v. 12 alludes to different degrees of punishment, with <i>the greatest Fire</i> being that for which <i>the most wretched</i> are destined (R). In Arabic, to say that one neither lives nor dies is to indicate that one is suffering great trials (R); see 35:36.</p>
087/014: He indeed prospers who is purified,
087/015: remembers the Name of his Lord and prays.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14<span class="HCSQ">–</span>15</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, <i>He indeed prospers who is purified</i> refers to purification from idolatry by professing God’s Oneness. Others say that it refers to purification through good deeds, while still others say it refers specifically to the alms given on <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>Īd al-fi<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>r</i> (Bg, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to Shiite tradition, the sixth Imam, Ja<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>far al-<span class="HCSQ">Ṣ</span>ādiq, stated that the order of the verses refers to the alms being given in the morning before the two cycles of the <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Īd prayer.</p><p class="indent">Here <i>prayer</i> is taken by most as a reference to the five canonical prayers, and by some as a reference to the congregational prayer said on the morning of <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>Īd al-fi<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>r</i> (Bg). According to some, <i>remembers the Name of his Lord</i> refers to mentioning the Name of God in the <i>basmalah</i> at the beginning of each prayer (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s); others emphasize that it means to remember with both heart and tongue, as remembering God with the tongue while being heedless of God in the heart has no benefit and no reward (Āl). These two verses can be taken together as referring to worshipping with all aspects of one’s being by purifying the heart, remembering God with the tongue, and performing the actions commanded by God, the foremost of which is prayer (Āl).</p>
087/016: Nay, but you prefer the life of this world,
087/017: while the Hereafter is better and more enduring.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">16<span class="HCSQ">–</span>17</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, <i>you</i> is here an address to the disbelievers, while others say that it refers to all of humanity. Regarding the relationship between this world and the Hereafter, a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “The world is the prison of the believer and the garden of the disbeliever”; see 93:4c.</p>
087/018: Truly this is in the scriptures of old,
087/019: the scriptures of Abraham and Moses.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>This</i> refers to either the subjects mentioned in vv. 14<span class="HCSQ">–</span>17 (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), the whole of this <i>sūrah</i> (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), or the entire Quran, as in 26:196: <i>It is indeed in the scriptures of those of old</i> (Āl). Although Judaism and Christianity do not ascribe a revealed book to Abraham, that Abraham had a particular scripture is implied in both the Quran and the <i><span class="HCSQIt">Ḥ</span>adīth</i>. When the Prophet was asked how many revealed books there were, he responded, “One hundred and four books. He sent down fifty scrolls to Seth, thirty scrolls to Idrīs, ten scrolls to Abraham, and ten scrolls [understood by some to be tablets (<i>alwā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span></i>)] to Moses before the Torah. And He sent down the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and the Criterion [i.e., the Quran]” (Āl). This tradition has a slightly different narration in Shiite sources (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s); some say the scrolls revealed to Abraham were twenty in number.</p>



088/001: Hast thou heard tell of the overwhelming event?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>The beginning of the verse can also be rendered, “Thou hast heard tell” (Āl). If understood as a question, it is rhetorical, for emphasis. In the context of this <i>sūrah, the overwhelming event</i> most likely refers to the Day of Resurrection, whose grandeur will overcome all of humanity (cf. 12:107; JJ). But it is also taken by some to mean that Hell will “cover” or “overwhelm” the people in layers (cf. 7:41; Āl) or that the Fire will overwhelm the faces of disbelievers (cf. 14:50; <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
088/002: Faces that Day shall be humbled,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Here, <i>humbled</i> means abased or humiliated (IK, JJ), Cf. 75:24. Unlike humility that one experiences in this world, this humility will reportedly be of no benefit to disbelievers (IK) since the door to repentance is open only in this world, not in the Hereafter.</p>
088/003: toiling, weary,
088/004: entering a scorching Fire,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Toiling, weary</i> can be understood as a reference to their toil in the <i>scorching Fire,</i> which is said to be dragging chains and shackles, or to their toil in this world, which is for naught if done in opposition to God (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others see <i>toiling</i> as a reference to performing disobedient acts in this world and <i>weary</i> as a reference to suffering in the Fire (IK). <i>Ta<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>lā,</i> here rendered “entering,” can also be read <i>Tu<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>lā</i>, meaning, “made to enter.”</p>
088/005: given drink from a boiling spring.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Boiling spring</i> refers to water at the highest possible heat (cf. 55:44; IK), a stark contrast to the <i>flowing spring</i> in v. 12.</p>
088/006: They will have no food, save a vile thorn,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Vile thorn</i> translates <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>arī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>,</i> which is the name given to the dry version of a bitter and thorny desert shrub called <i>shibrīq</i>. When dry, it is said to be so vile that no animal will eat it (Āl, Bg, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Some say that it designates a tree of the Fire (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), similar to <i>Zaqqūm</i> in 37:62; 44:43; and 56:52. According to a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “<i><span class="HCSQIt">Ḍ</span>arī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span></i> is a thing in the Fire that resembles thorns. It is bitterer than aloes, more fetid than a putrid corpse, and more burning than fire. God has named the thing <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>arī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span></i>” (Q). Some say <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>arī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span></i> means “poison” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others say that it derives from the verb <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ara<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a,</i> meaning “to humble” or “to abase,” because eating <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>arī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span></i> is part of the humiliation and abasement for those in the Fire (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Most commentators agree that it is not the same as other things the disbelievers will be made to eat in Hell, such as <i>Zaqqūm</i> and <i>filth</i> (<i>ghislīn;</i> 69:36), but that these refer to the vegetation found in different levels of the Fire (Q).</p>
088/007: which neither nourishes nor avails against hunger.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>It is related that in response to v. 6 the Arabs said, “Our camels are nourished by <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>arī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>,</i>” though it was actually <i>shibrīq,</i> the shrub before it dried. So this verse was revealed (Bg, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>

Here <i>they</i> is based upon reading the faces in v. 8 as the subject of the verb. It could also be understood as an address to the Prophet in the second person singular, “thou hearest no idle talk therein.” In another variant, the verb is read in the passive <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1508" title="1508"/>with <i>idle talk</i> as the subject, “no idle talk is heard therein.”</p>

The camel is thus seen in many commentaries and in Islamic literature in general as one of the supreme examples of God’s Wisdom and Power. The reference to camels can also be understood as an allusion to the docile nature of camels, who despite their strength will yield to one who is leading them. In this sense, the verse could be read as chastising human beings for not yielding to the guidance of God in the manner that camels yield to their guides (ST).</p>

Some interpret <i>even</i> as a reference to all of creation, for as 78:6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8 says, <i>Did We not . . . create you in pairs,</i> and <i>odd</i> as a reference to God, Who is One without peer, hence odd (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to a saying attributed to the Prophet, this verse refers to the prayers, most of which have an even number of prayer cycles, and one of which, the sunset prayer (<i>maghrib</i>), has an odd number of cycles (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others say that <i>odd</i> refers to the Day of <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Arafah, which is the ninth day of the <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ajj,</i> and that <i>even</i> refers to either the eighth day, when the pilgrims travel to Mt. <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Arafāt, or the tenth day, which is the Feast of Sacrifice (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to other interpretations, <i>the odd</i> refers to Adam, and <i>the even</i> to Eve (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s); <i>the even</i> refers to <span class="HCSQ">Ṣ</span>afā and Marwah, between which the pilgrims pass during the pilgrimage, and <i>the odd</i> refers to the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).

089/004: and by the night as it recedes;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most commentators interpret this verse as a reference to night in general (Q, R), in which case it is seen to indicate the Wisdom of God’s measuring between night and day (R).

089/008: the like of which was never created in all the land,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Iram</i> is believed to refer to either a particular people or the city of the <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād. Several sources cite the Arabian legend that this city was built by Shaddād, the son of <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād, with gold and silver and trees full of jewels. Some say <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād was a son of <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Aw<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span>, the son of Iram, the son of Sham, the son of Noah, and since the name of the ancestor of a tribe was used for the tribe, the tribe of <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād was also called Iram (Z). Iram is then taken as a reference to <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>Ād the Former</i> (53:50), while <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād the Latter were simply referred to as <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād. According to this interpretation, <i>pillared</i> refers to the tall stature of the people. If taken as a reference to a city where they lived, <i>pillared</i> refers to the architecture of their city. <i>Pillared</i> can also be seen as a reference to the quality of their stature, as in Arabic to say individuals are <i>rafī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span> al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>imād,</i> literally “with raised pillar,” means that they are of a noble stature.</p>

089/013: So thy Lord poured upon them the scourge of punishment.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">13</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Poured</i> indicates the continuous nature of the punishment that is realized in this life and the next. <i>Scourge</i> translates <i>saw<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>,</i> which indicates something that is mixed in various ways. Thus it also means a “whip,” which is woven of various materials. Here it indicates either the nature of the punishment in which blood and flesh are said to be mixed together or to the various punishments that afflicted the three peoples (Q, R): <i>a howling, raging wind</i> for the tribe of <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ād (69:6; cf. 41:16; 51:41; 54:19), an “overwhelming” earthquake for the tribe of Thamūd (69:5; cf. 7:78), and the drowning of Pharaoh and his host (2:50; 7:136c; 8:54; 10:90; 17:102<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3; 28:40; 43:55; 44:23<span class="HCSQ">–</span>24; 51:40).</p>
089/014: Truly thy Lord lies in ambush.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14</span><span class="hide">  </span>Nothing escapes God, for He is ever watchful, hearing what people say in public and private, seeing what they do publicly and privately, and rewarding or punishing them accordingly (Q; cf. 78:21). The point is that no matter what respite God may allow for tyrants to work corruption, they will be punished for it in due time, as in 3:178; 7:182<span class="HCSQ">–</span>83; 22:48.</p>
089/015: As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, then honors him and blesses him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.”
089/016: And as for whenever He tries him and straitens his provision, he says, “My Lord has abased me.”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 22:11; 23:55<span class="HCSQ">–</span>56; 30:36; 41:51. Human beings are inclined to think that wealth and status are marks of true worth or signs of one’s standing with God, forgetting that God <i>outspreads and straitens provision for whomsoever He will</i> (13:26; 17:30; 28:82; 29:62; 30:37; 34:36, 39; 39:52; 42:12; see 34:39c) and that <i>surely the most noble of you before God are the most reverent of you</i> (49:13). Al-Rāzī connects the present verses to 30:7: <i>They know some outward aspect of the life of this world, but of the Hereafter they are heedless;</i> and to 22:11: <i>And among mankind some worship God upon a brink: if good befalls him, he is content thereby, but if a trial befalls him, he is turned over upon his face.</i> The implication is that human beings forget the balance between the things of this world and those of the next. What appears to be a benefit in this world may in fact be a detriment in the next, and one who appears abased here may in fact be honored in the Hereafter, and vice-versa. With regard to the balance between this world and the next, the more people incline to the sensory things of this world, the more difficult will be their passage from it (R). According to a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth qudsī,</i> “God says, ‘Truly I do not honor one whom I have honored with worldly abundance; and I do not abase one whom I have abased with paucity thereof. I only honor one whom I have honored with obedience unto Me; and I only abase one whom I have abased with disobedience unto Me’” (Q).</p>
089/017: Nay, but you honor not the orphan,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>20</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Nay</i> is a rebuke to those who make the errors implied in vv. 15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16 (Q, R). The accusation that they <i>devour inheritance</i> and do not <i>honor the orphan</i> alludes to the abuse of the inheritance bequeathed to orphans, a point that is addressed in 2:220; 4:2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3, 8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10, 127; 6:152 (cf. 107:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3). Some read all of these verses in the third-person plural rather than the second-person plural (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Either reading is accepted. Following upon vv. 15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16, the implication of vv. 17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>20 is that failure to appreciate the true nature of God’s honoring and abasing leads people to act inequitably toward those who are less privileged (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
089/018: nor urge you the feeding of the indigent.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18</span><span class="hide">  </span>There is disagreement about how <i>urge you</i> should be read. It can be read in two ways in <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1512" title="1512"/>the second-person plural: transitive, <i>ta<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ūna,</i> meaning “nor urge you,” or reflexive, <i>ta<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ūna,</i> meaning “nor urge you one another.” And it can be read two ways in the third-person plural: transitive, <i>ya<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ūna,</i> meaning “nor do they urge,” or reflexive, <i>yu<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ūna,</i> meaning “nor do they urge one another” (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). When read in the third person, it is seen as applying to those mentioned in vv. 15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16 (cf. 69:34).</p>
089/019: You devour inheritance with rapacious devouring,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">19</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse means that people consume whatever they can find without knowing or questioning whether it is permitted (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>alāl</i>) or forbidden (<i><span class="HCSQIt">Ḥ</span>arām;</i> <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Here it implies that they consume both their own share of an inheritance and that of others (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>

089/021: Nay, but when the earth is ground up, grinding upon grinding,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">21</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Nay</i> is a response to those who commit the sins mentioned in vv. 17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>20. <i>Ground up</i> implies that all things have been destroyed and reduced to sand, as if by a great earthquake (Q, R; cf. 20:105<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7; 56:5; 69:14; 79:6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7). According to some this grinding will prepare the plain on which all human beings and jinn will then be gathered for the Reckoning on the Day of Judgment (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>; see 18:47c; 20:106; 79:14c).</p>
089/022: and your Lord comes with the angels, row upon row;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">22</span><span class="hide">  </span>As God is not considered to have a body or be a “thing” that can be said to be in a particular place or to move from one place to another, some commentators read this verse as an allusion to God’s Power, Decree, or Command (Q, R). Others say that it indicates God’s Presence, because true knowledge (<i>ma<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>rifah</i>) of God will come on that Day, even if some had denied God before it (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). It is said that the angels will be lined up like Muslims in prayer (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others say the angels will descend from every heaven forming lines around the believers (R; cf. 78:38).</p>
089/023: and Hell is brought forth that Day; that Day man will remember; yet whence will that remembrance avail him?
089/024: He will say, “Would that I had sent forth for my life!”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">23<span class="HCSQ">–</span>24</span><span class="hide">  </span>With regard to <i>Hell . . . brought forth,</i> a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “Hellfire will be brought forth that Day and it will have seventy thousand leashes, and each leash will have seventy thousand angels pulling it” (IK, Q). These verses indicate that people will remember how they conducted themselves in this world, but there will be no opportunity for repentance or to make up for lost time. Most commentators say <i>Would that I had sent forth for my life</i> means, “Would that I had sent forth good deeds that would save me from the Fire” (Q, R). Yet even believers will have some regret, since as a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “There is no time wherein the son of Adam does not remember God, but that it will be a source of regret for him on the Day of Judgment.”</p>
089/025: That Day none punishes as He punishes,
089/026: and none binds as He binds.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">25<span class="HCSQ">–</span>26</span><span class="hide">  </span>Ultimately, God will be the only one who punishes anyone on the Day of Judgment, meaning that there is no punishment like the punishment inflicted on that Day. The binding alludes to the chains and shackles mentioned in 13:5; 34:33; 36:8; 40:71; 76:4. Others read, “He punishes none with his punishment, and He binds none with his binding” (Āl, Qu, R), meaning that God will not punish anyone with the punishment of another or that God will not punish anyone as severely as He punishes the disbelievers (Qu). This interpretation could be general, meaning that no one suffers the punishment or binding due another, since <i>none shall bear the burden of another</i> (6:164; 17:15; 35:18; 39:7; 53:38; Āl, R, Z). It could also be specific, applying to a particular individual (Āl, Q, Z) or to Satan (Āl).</p>

They play an important role in Muslim piety, as they are often recited in eulogies for the dead and are seen by Sufis and others as a reference to the true nature of the soul when it is purified of all defilements.</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">27</span><span class="hide">  </span>The <i>soul at peace</i> is said to be the soul that has certainty (Q, Qu, R); this is the meaning of Abraham’s request to God in 2:260, <i>So that my heart may be at peace</i> (R). The <i>soul at peace</i> is also said to possess true knowledge, or gnosis (<i>ma<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>rifah;</i> Qu, R). Elsewhere the soul is said to be <i>at peace in the remembrance of God</i> (13:28; Q, Qu, R). From one perspective, the degree of remembrance is in accord with the strength of certainty (Āl), both of which are in accord with the degree of peace. Others speak of the soul so illuminated by the heart that all blameworthy character traits have been removed and all praiseworthy character traits are manifest (Jurjānī, <i>al-Ta<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>rīfāt,</i> 239). It is reported that Ubayy ibn Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>b (d. 29/649), one of the leading authorities on the Quran among the Prophet’s Companions, read this verse as “O thou soul secure (<i>āminah</i>), at peace” (Q, R), implying the soul that is not fazed by fear or sorrow (Aj, R), unlike those described in vv. 15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16.</p><p class="indent">The soul is said to have three levels: the <i>soul at peace</i> (v. 27), which is in command of its lusts and desires and has attained certainty; <i>the blaming soul</i> (75:2), which strives to overcome its lusts and desires; and <i>the soul</i> that <i>commands to evil</i> (12:53), which is at the mercy of its lusts and desires; see 75:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2c; 12:53c. The <i>soul at peace</i> is said to be “that which issues from the light of the first [Divine] Address, through which it was brought into being out of nonexistence by the light of pretemporality (<i>nūr al-qidam</i>) and it is at peace with the Real [i.e., God], with His Address, and in union with Him (<i>wa bi wi<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>ālihi</i>). Then its Lord calls it to its first origin (<i>ma<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>din</i>), wherein it inclines, from the first to the last, toward nothing other than witnessing God, content with God through God and content in the Presence of God” (Aj).</p>
089/028: Return unto thy Lord, content, contenting.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">28</span><span class="hide">  </span>That the soul returns to its Lord is understood to imply that it was with its Lord in the Garden before creation (R). Many interpret this verse to mean <i>content</i> with the reward of God and <i>contenting</i> to God for having performed good deeds (Q, R). Others understand it as an indication that one is content with everything that God has decreed for all matters. Still others take it as an indication that the soul returns to the Divine Essence in a state of complete contentment (Aj, K), in which case, <i>content, contenting</i> could be read as two different levels of contentment: the first is the contentment experienced from God through God, and the second, the contentment experienced when standing before God (Aj). Some emphasize that there can be no contentment with God until God is content with souls, as in 5:119; 9:100; 58:22; and 98:8: <i>God being content with them and they being content with Him</i> (K). Contentment is seen by some as one of the most important virtues; it has been described as “the greatest gate of God and the paradise of this world” (Qu, <i>Risālah</i>).</p>

089/030: Enter My Garden.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">29<span class="HCSQ">–</span>30</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Among My servants</i> means among the righteous servants, as in the supplication of Solomon in 27:19: <i>My Lord, . . . cause me to enter, through Thy Mercy, among Thy righteous servants!</i> (Aj; cf. 29:9). In this sense it is read as an address to the spiritual elect (K). Some read, “Enter into My servants,” meaning their bodies, thus alluding to spirits returning to bodies for the bodily resurrection (Q, R, Sy, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Some say it can mean both at the same time (Āl). According to several <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ādīth,</i> the Hereafter has progressive levels with lower and higher gardens. Thus, while most take <i>My Garden</i> as an allusion to Paradise in general, some take it as an allusion to the highest Garden, the Garden of the Divine Essence, in the very Presence of God (K); see the essay “Death, Dying, and the Afterlife in the Quran.”</p>



090/001: Nay, I swear by this land,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some read this verse without <i>Nay,</i> interpreting that the article <i>lā</i> as one of emphasis rather than negation (Q). When read as an article of negation, it can be seen as a rebuke to those who are of the disposition criticized in vv. 5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>11 (Q) or as a rebuke to the Quraysh (IK). <i>Land,</i> translating <i>balad,</i> can refer to Arabia, though a majority read it as “city,” referring to Makkah (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s, Z), and a minority say it refers to Madinah (Q). <i>Balad</i> can also be read in a more general manner as a reference to the earth.</p>
090/002: hile thou art free in this land;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most interpret this verse to mean that the Prophet is free to act as he deems best in Makkah (IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). In this sense, it is seen as a direct response to the conquest of Makkah in 8/630 or, if revealed during the Makkan period, as a premonition of the conquest, in which a few members of the Quraysh were slain. Even in pre-Islamic times, Makkah was considered sacrosanct and fighting there was prohibited. That the Muslim armies spilled blood there during the conquest was thus seen as a grave violation. It is reported that the Prophet said, “Truly God made Makkah sacred on the day that He created the heavens and the earth. Therefore, it is sacred until the Hour is come [i.e., the end of time]. And it was not made lawful (<i>tu<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>alla</i>) to any before me and will not be made lawful to any after me; and it was only made lawful to me for one hour of a day” (IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others say that this verse refers to God giving the Prophet free passage through Makkah, even if the Quraysh did not (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), for, as the Quraysh were the keepers of the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah, it was a disgrace for them to not allow someone, let alone one of God’s messengers, access to it. The verse could also be read, “And thou art present in the land,” alluding to the fact that this land has been honored by God with the presence of His Messenger (R).</p>
090/003: and [by] the begetter, and that which he begat,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The begetter, and that which he begat</i> means Adam and his progeny, or every begetter and every begotten (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), thus all of humanity from its beginning to its end. Or the phrase can be seen as a reference to Abraham and Ishmael (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s) or to Ishmael and his progeny (Q), both linking it to <i>this land</i> because of Abraham’s association with Makkah and because Ishmael was seen as the father of the Arabs; see 2:126c. Another metaphorical interpretation states that <i>the begetter</i> is the Prophet and <i>that which he begat</i> is his community (Q). Some also read it as an allusion to the Prophet’s descent from Abraham (ST).</p>
090/004: truly We created man in travail.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>Many commentators relate this verse to the interpretation attributed to al-<span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>asan al-Ba<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span>rī, “Enduring the hardships of the world in life and the severities of the Hereafter” (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others relate it to 46:15, <i>His mother carried him in travail and bore him in travail,</i> and see it as a reference to the hardships of this world: from birth, to weaning, to earning a living, to growing old, to facing death (IK, R), for in life there is naught but toil and trial (R). Others see it as a reference to the trials of death, the grave, and the Day of Judgment (R). <i>Travail</i> translates <i>kabad,</i> which can also mean “erect” or “upright.” When read this way, this verse is sometimes interpreted as a reference to man being the only creature that walks upright upon two legs (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
090/005: Does he suppose that none will ever have power over him?
090/006: He says, “I have squandered vast wealth!”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6</span><span class="hide">  </span>V. 5 asks, “Does man not think that he will be held accountable for all his actions?” In context, the implication is that those who are deluded by their own wealth do not realize that God <i>outspreads and straitens provision for whomsoever He will</i> (13:26; 17:30; 28:82; 29:62; 30:37; 34:36, 39) and can remove their wealth at any moment. It also implies both that people will be taken to account for how they have spent their wealth and that they are responsible for the manner in which wealth is obtained, no matter how philanthropic they may be. Some have said that v. 6 refers to <span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>arith ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Āmir, who, when the Prophet advised <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1516" title="1516"/>him to pay money for the atonement of a sin, objected, “My money has gone to atonements and payments since the day I entered the religion of Muhammad” (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), thus implying that he did not understand the spiritual value of his expenditures and thought he had squandered his wealth.</p>
090/007: Does he suppose that no one sees him?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse asks, “Do people think that God will not ask how they obtained their wealth and how they spent it?” (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Some say this refers to a specific individual who claimed to have spent money for Islam, though he had not spent anything (R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). A <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “The servant does not move forward on the Day of Resurrection until he has been asked about three things: about his years, how he passed them; about his wealth, from what he acquired it and on what he spent it; and about his knowledge, what he did with it” (Āl); a Shiite version adds a fourth, “and about his love for the People of the Household [i.e., the family of the Prophet]” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>

090/009: a tongue, and two lips,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9</span><span class="hide">  </span>The implication is that one who is able to make these subtle instruments from which human beings derive great benefit would certainly be able to know every deed and hold human beings accountable for what they have done with these instruments.</p>
090/010: and guide him upon the two highways?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The two highways</i> are interpreted to be those of good and evil, as in a well-known <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “O people! There are only two highways: the highway of good and the highway of evil. Make not the highway of evil more beloved to you than the highway of good” (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Some commentators relate this to 76:3: <i>Truly We guided him upon the way, be he grateful or ungrateful</i> (IK, R).</p>
090/011: Yet he has not assailed the steep pass.
090/012: And what will apprise thee of the steep pass?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Assail</i> translates <i>iqta<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ama,</i> meaning to do something with great intensity (R, Z) or to throw oneself into something without consideration of the consequences (Āl, Q). The implication is that those who contribute money for religious purposes, but then regret it, saying, <i>I have squandered vast wealth</i> (v. 6), or those who have failed to engage fully in similar religious duties have not achieved the full measure of sincerity<span class="HCSQ">—</span>have not fully embarked upon the highway of good<span class="HCSQ">—</span>and are not thankful for the great blessings God has provided, such as those mentioned in vv. 8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9. Thus al-Zamakhsharī glosses v. 11 with 3:117: <i>The parable of what they spend in this life of the world is that of a frigid wind that strikes the tillage of a people who have wronged themselves, destroying it. God wrongs them not, but themselves do they wrong.</i> In this interpretation, <i>the steep pass</i> is a metaphorical reference to distributing wealth in the manner mentioned in vv. 13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>17 and accomplishing meritorious deeds. It is thus likened to “striving” (<i>mujāhadah</i>) for God (Q, R), as in a famous saying attributed to al-<span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>asan al-Ba<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span>rī, “<i>The steep pass</i> of God is severe; it is the human being’s striving against his soul, his caprice, and his enemy, Satan” (Q, R). Some view <i>the steep pass</i> as an allusion to one or several of the obstacles that disbelievers will encounter in the Hereafter (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Given what follows in vv. 13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>17, many read v. 12 to mean, “What will apprise thee of assailing the steep pass?” (Q). Al-Tustarī likens assailing <i>the steep pass</i> to attaining spiritual knowledge (<i>ma<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>rifah</i>), which can only be done through the power and strength of God by which one frees the soul of desire (ST).</p>
090/013: [It is] the freeing of a slave,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">13</span><span class="hide">  </span>A <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “Whoever releases a believing slave (<i>raqabah</i>), he will be his ransom from the Fire” (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). There is a debate as to which is more praiseworthy, charity (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>adaqah</i>) or the manumission of a slave. Some point to the placement of this verse before the following verses as an indication that manumission is superior (Q, R). This verse can also imply that one should free one’s own neck (<i>raqabah</i>) through repentance (Bg, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s) or by performing the acts of worship by which one attains Paradise, since that is considered to be the greatest freedom (R).</p>
090/014: or giving food at a time of famine<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse points to the fact that giving one’s wealth is more difficult in times of need, though of greater benefit. Thus al-Rāzī glosses this verse with 2:177; and 76:8: <i>And give food, <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1517" title="1517"/>despite loving it, to the indigent, the orphan, and the captive.</i></p>
090/015: to an orphan near of kin,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse constitutes two meritorious acts, as one should be generous toward orphans and toward relatives (Q, R).

090/016: or an indigent, clinging to the dust,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">16</span><span class="hide">  </span>An indigent is one who has no home other than the dust (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
090/017: while being one of those who believe and exhort one another to patience, and exhort one another to compassion.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17</span><span class="hide">  </span>One does not <i>assail the steep pass</i> by simply performing the deeds mentioned in vv. 13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16; one must do so on the basis of belief in God, the requisite condition for God’s acceptance of such deeds, as in 9:54: <i>And naught prevented their spending from being accepted from them, save that they disbelieved in God and in His Messenger, and only come to the prayer lazily, and only spend reluctantly</i> (Q). Exhorting to <i>patience</i> (cf. 103:3) pertains to encouraging one another in maintaining religious practice in the face of difficulties and opposition, and exhorting to <i>compassion</i> pertains to encouraging one another toward mercy unto God’s creatures (R). As a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “The merciful are those unto whom the Merciful is merciful. Be merciful unto those on earth, and He who is in Heaven will be merciful unto you.”</p>

091/002: by the moon when following it;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be read as an allusion to the moon’s receiving its light from the sun (IK, Q, R) or to the new crescent moon, which at the start of each lunar month is visible above the horizon near where the sun sets and itself sets soon thereafter (IK, Q). It could also be seen as an allusion to the differing orbits of the moon and the sun, which can be used to measure the passage of time; see 36:40c.</p>
091/003: by the day when disclosing it;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 92:2. <i>It</i> can be taken as a reference to the sun (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>) or to the world or the earth (Q). <i>It</i> can also be seen as a reference to “the darkness” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), in which case the verse would read “by the day when dispersing it.” From a spiritual perspective, this verse can be read as an allusion to the light of faith extinguishing the darkness of ignorance (ST).</p>
091/004: by the night when enshrouding it;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse refers to the night enshrouding the sun (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>) or enshrouding the world (Q); cf. 92:1. From a spiritual perspective, it can be read as an allusion to sins, persistence in which covers the light of faith (ST).</p>
091/005: by the sky and the One Who established it;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, <i>the One Who</i> in these three verses is not appropriate, since God could not swear upon Himself (R). They would thus read “that which” in place of <i>the One Who</i>. Or the three verses could be read, “its being established” (v. 5), “its being spread” (v. 6), and “its fashioning” (v. 7; Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), the reading preferred by al-Qur<span class="HCSQ">ṭ</span>ubī.</p>
091/006: by the earth and the One Who spread it;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 51:47<span class="HCSQ">–</span>48: <i>And the sky We established with might; truly We make vast! And the earth We laid out—what excellent spreaders!</i> V. 6 is taken by some to mean, “What He created in it,” and by others to mean that He proportioned it (IK).</p>
091/007: by the soul and the One Who fashioned it<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The One Who fashioned it</i> means the One Who created the soul sound and well proportioned, as it was in the original primordial nature (<i>fi<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>rah</i>), as indicated in 30:30: <i>Set thy face to religion as a</i> <span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>anīf, <i>in the primordial nature from God upon which He originated mankind</i> (IK). Here <i>the soul</i> can be taken as an allusion to the soul of Adam, or the souls of all human beings. As such, it is a call to meditate upon the true nature of the human being, since God <i>created man in the most beautiful stature</i> (95:4; cf. 40:64: My). The invocation of the soul in the midst of this series of polarities implies that the soul has an inherent duality, as becomes clear in the following verses and in 79:37<span class="HCSQ">–</span>41. This duality is seen by many in the pair <i>the soul at peace</i> (89:27), which is in control of its lusts and desires and has attained certainty, and <i>the soul</i> that <i>commands to evil</i> (12:53); an intermediate station between the two is <i>the blaming soul</i> (75:2); see 75:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2c; 89:27c.</p>
091/008: and inspired it as to what makes it iniquitous or reverent.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>As translated, this verse indicates that God taught the soul the nature of evil and good and set the course for which it should follow. Thus some relate it to 90:8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10: <i>Did We not . . . guide him upon the two highways?</i> (Q, Sh). It could also be rendered, “He placed its iniquity and its reverence within it” (IK). In both translations it can be taken as a reference to God’s instillation of the knowledge of good and evil in every human soul, even before various prophetic revelations. As other verses indicate (e.g., 75:14<span class="HCSQ">–</span>15; 81:14; 82:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5), every soul is intrinsically aware of good and evil, right and wrong, its relation to God, and the covenant to which it attested (see 7:172).</p><p class="indent">These verses can also be read as an indication that God decrees all things for each human being, the reading preferred by most Ash<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>arite <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1520" title="1520"/>theologians. Regarding this interpretation, it is reported that a man asked the Prophet, “O Messenger of God! Do you consider the actions of mankind and their struggles to be something ordained (<i>qa<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ā<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span></i>) for them and coming to pass from a previous measuring out (<i>qadar</i>), or something written for them only after the Message came to them from their Prophet, when there will be a clear proof against them?” To which he replied, “Rather, it is ordained for them.” So the man said, “Then what is the point of our actions?” The Prophet replied, “Whosoever God created for one of the two positions [Paradise or Hell], He makes it easy for him [to attain]. The proof of that is in the Book of God: <i>By the soul and the One Who fashioned it and inspired it as to what makes it iniquitous or reverent</i>” (IK). It is also reported that when reciting this <i>sūrah,</i> the Prophet would stop at this verse and pray, “O God! Give my soul its reverence. Thou art its Protector and Master, and the best to purify it” (IK, Q).</p>
091/009: Indeed, he prospers who purifies it.
091/010: And indeed he fails who obscures it.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10</span><span class="hide">  </span>These two verses have served as the inspiration for extensive literature on the “purification of the soul” (<i>tazkiyyat al-nafs</i>), which some argue is the entire purpose of the Quran. Most take v. 9 to be the beginning of the answer to the oaths taken in vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7 (Bg, Sh); others say that the answer has been omitted from the text and is only implied (Sh). The text speaks of those who cleanse the soul of lowly and despicable character traits (IK) and, conversely, those who dull the soul by neglecting it through heedlessness and disobedience (IK). According to some of the earliest commentators, these two verses could also be read with God as the subject, meaning, “He whose soul God purifies has indeed prospered, and he whose soul God obscures has indeed failed” (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). The ambiguity of the subject can also be seen as an allusion to the cooperation between God and human beings, who work together to purify the soul, for, on the one hand, <i>Whosoever purifies himself purifies himself only for his own soul</i> (35:18), and on the other, <i>You do not will but that God wills</i> (76:30); thus 4:49 states, <i>Rather, it is God Who purifies whomsoever He will</i> (cf. 24:21). Nonetheless, there is a subtle reciprocity in every step one takes toward God, for as 13:11 proclaims: <i>Truly God alters not what is in a people until they alter what is in themselves.</i> The literal meaning of <i>purify</i> (<i>zakkā</i>) is “to grow,” and according to most the literal meaning of <i>obscure</i> (<i>dassa</i>) is “to bury” (Sh, Z). These verses could thus be translated, “He prospers who grows it, and he fails who buries it.” V. 9 thus indicates those who make the soul grow through purification, while v. 10 indicates those whose souls are buried in reprehensible acts.</p>
091/011: Thamūd denied in their rebelliousness,

091/013: So the messenger of God said to them, “[This is] the she-camel of God; give her drink!”
091/014: But they denied him, then hamstrung her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin, then leveled it;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14</span><span class="hide">  </span>The tribe of Thamūd is cited as an example of those who “obscure” the soul through disobedience. They were a pre-Islamic northern Arabian tribe who rejected the Prophet <span class="HCSQ">Ṣ</span>āli<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>; see 7:73<span class="HCSQ">–</span>79; 11:61<span class="HCSQ">–</span>68; 54:23<span class="HCSQ">–</span>31. It is said that after <span class="HCSQ">Ṣ</span>āli<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span> made it clear to them that a particular she-camel that God had brought forth from a rock was a sign of God and exhorted them to justice and the distribution of water ordained by God, their leader proceeded to hamstring the she-camel and leave her for dead (54:23<span class="HCSQ">–</span>30). For the <i>she-camel of God,</i> see 7:73c. For <i>give her drink,</i> see 26:155c. According to some commentators, they had agreed that the she-camel would drink one day and the other animals would drink the next, and the people killed the she-camel because they did not like this arrangement (see 54:27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>29).</p><p class="indent">It is recorded that the Prophet said that the <i>most wretched</i> of previous generations (<i>al-awwalīn</i>) are those who hamstrung the she-camel (IK, Q). Some interpret <i>hamstrung her</i> (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>aqqarūhā</i>) as “slaughtered her”; see 7:77<span class="HCSQ">–</span>78c. <i>Crushed them</i> <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1521" title="1521"/>(<i>damdama <span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>alayhim</i>) indicates the most severe of punishments that came upon them suddenly, annihilating them and covering them entirely. <i>Leveled it</i> translates <i>sawwāhā,</i> which has a broad range of meaning; as translated it indicates that God razed their city or that he leveled the earth over them. It could also be rendered, “He distributed it equally,” meaning that God distributed the same punishment upon every member of the tribe (IK, Q). The verb <i>sawwā</i> is also translated <i>fashioned</i> in v. 7 and in relation to the creation of human beings in 18:37; 32:9; 75:38; 82:7. The use of <i>sawwā</i> in this context, in relation to both the creation of human beings in v. 7 and their destruction in v. 14, indicates, on the one hand, that God can destroy human beings as easily as He created them and, on the other, that God’s Punishment is part of the continuing process through which God fashions the human soul.</p>
091/015: for He fears not the consequence thereof.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse means that God does not fear the consequences of destroying a people like the tribe of Thamūd (IK, Q). It is thus a warning to the tribe of Quraysh that God has no need of them and could wipe them out just as easily as He did the tribe of Thamūd. It could also be rendered, “And he did not fear its outcome,” in which case the subject is either <i>the most wretched</i> (v. 12), who hamstrung the she-camel and did not fear the outcome of his actions because of his heedlessness (Q), or the Prophet <span class="HCSQ">Ṣ</span>āli<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>, who did not fear the outcome because he had fulfilled his duty by transmitting God’s message and was spared their punishment (Q).</p>

As with 91:5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7, some maintain this second reading is more appropriate, because God would not swear upon Himself. The creation of human beings <i>in pairs</i> is also presented as containing symbolic meaning in 78:8, and 53:45 states, <i>He creates the two</i> (<i>zawjayn</i>)<i>—male and female,</i> which are said to be <i>mates</i> (<i>azwāj</i>) created <i>from a single soul</i> (4:1; 7:189; 39:6). The reference to the male and female can be seen as an allusion to the outward polarity of created forms, while the remainder of the <i>sūrah</i> refers to the inner spiritual polarity between those who reverence the truth and those who deny it. In this context, it can also be read as an indication that the final ends of both males and females are not determined by their gender, but by the degree of their reverence, as in 49:13: <i>O mankind! Truly We created you from a male and a female, and We made you peoples and tribes that you may come to know one another. Surely the most noble of you before God are the most reverent of you.</i></p>
092/004: truly your endeavors are diverse.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>In this context “endeavoring” (<i>sa<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>y</i>) can be taken as a synonym for doing or acting (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>amal</i>), implying that people work for either redemption or perdition and that there is no in-between (Sh).</p>
092/005: As for one who gives and is reverent,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10</span><span class="hide">  </span><span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Alī ibn Abī <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>ālib related that the Prophet said, “There is no one among you except that his place is registered in either the Garden or the Fire!” Someone asked, “O Messenger of God, then what of works?” He said, “Perform works; everyone is eased unto that for which he was created,” and then he recited vv. 5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10 (IK). Citing the last part of this <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> al-Zamakhsharī says that the meaning is, “We will make it amiable to him and grant him success until obedience [to God] becomes the easiest and simplest of things for him, as in His saying, <i>Whomsoever God wishes to guide, He expands his breast for submission</i> [6:125].”</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Gives</i> is understood by most to mean giving in charity, but can also indicate giving God His proper due (Sh).</p>
092/006: and attests to what is most beautiful,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>What is most beautiful</i> (<i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>usnā</i>), here and in v. 9, is taken by most to mean “There is no god but God” (Sh) or simply belief in God (Z), so that either of these is what is being attested to or denied; others see it as a reference to Paradise, which is referred to as <i>the most beautiful reward</i> in 3:148 and 3:195 (IK, Sh, Z). But it can also be seen as a reference to God Himself, for, as several verses attest, <i>Unto Him belong the Most Beautiful Names</i> (17:110; 20:8; 59:24; cf. 7:180).</p>
092/007: We shall ease his way unto ease.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 87:8. As 2:185 states, <i>God desires ease for you, and He does not desire hardship for you</i>. Nonetheless, ease in one’s affairs derives from reverence, as in 65:4: <i>And whosoever reverences God, He will appoint ease for his affair.</i></p>
092/008: And as for one who is miserly and deems himself beyond need,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 96:6<span class="HCSQIt">–</span>7. <i>Beyond need</i> literally means “self-sufficient,” but <i>beyond need</i> better conveys the negative connotation of viewing oneself as “self-sufficient” vis-à-vis God. Being <i>miserly</i> toward those below one’s station and having the illusion of self-sufficiency in relation to what is above is an inversion of the proper balance between Heaven and earth or God and human beings, in which people must be obedient to God and generous toward others.</p>
092/009: and denies what is most beautiful,<p class="indent"><span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1524" title="1524"/><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>What is most beautiful</i> here can mean the reward of the Garden, the reality of the Garden itself, the Reality of God, or all three; see also 92:6c.</p>
092/010: We shall ease his way unto hardship;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span>Just as there is reciprocity when turning to God in repentance, so too there is reciprocity when turning away from God in disobedience. <i>Hardship</i> is glossed by many with “evil” (Sh). This can be taken to imply that when people disbelieve and commit evil deeds, God opens the way for them to commit further evil and it becomes increasingly difficult to turn back, as implied by the diverse nature of good and evil deeds alluded to in v. 4.</p>
092/011: and his wealth shall not avail him when he perishes.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11</span><span class="hide">  </span>Alternately, “What will his wealth avail him when he perishes?” <i>Perishes</i> can be taken to mean when he dies or when he enters the Fire (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
092/012: Truly Ours it is to give guidance,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">12</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some understand this verse to mean, “We will explain what is lawful and what is prohibited” (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Others take it to indicate that one who travels the path of guidance will reach God in the Hereafter (IK). It can also be likened to other verses that explain that it is God’s place to guide and no one else’s, as in 16:9: <i>And it is for God to show the way</i> (IK, Q).</p>
092/013: and truly unto Us belong the Hereafter and this world.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">13</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 53:25: <i>Yet unto God belong the Hereafter and this world.</i> Some commentators see this verse as a reference to the reward of the Hereafter and this world, as in 4:134: <i>Whosoever desires the reward of this world, with God is the reward of this world and the Hereafter</i> (Q), in which case, one could also see it as an allusion to the punishment of this world and the Hereafter, as in 79:25: <i>So God seized him with a punishment exemplary in the Hereafter and in this world.</i> Others see this verse as an indication that everything is God’s and He does with it as He wills (Sh).</p>
092/014: Thus have I warned you of a raging Fire,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">14</span><span class="hide">  </span>Elsewhere Hell is described as a <i>crushing Fire</i> (104:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5).</p>
092/015: which none shall enter, save the most wretched,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21</span><span class="hide">  </span>Several commentators say that the whole of this <i>sūrah</i> was revealed in reference to a Muslim of Madinah who had a palm tree, a branch of which was bent toward the house of a poor man who had a large family. Sometimes the owner of the palm tree would collect the fruit and, if by chance some dates fell in the poor man’s yard and his children picked them up, the owner would come and snatch them away from their hands and even from their mouths. The poor man complained to the Prophet, who then asked the owner of the tree if he would give him the tree in question in return for a palm tree in Paradise. The man declined, pleading that the dates of that tree, among all his numerous trees, were so delicate that he could not give up the tree. Another man heard what the Prophet had promised the owner and said, “O Messenger of God! Would you promise the same to me, were I to obtain the palm tree from the owner and give it to you?” The Prophet said, “Yes.” Whereupon he went to the owner of the palm tree and asked whether he wanted to sell it. The owner demanded forty palm trees, a sum he thought no one would pay. Though the buyer was astonished and told him that it was exorbitant, after a short pause he agreed to give him forty palm trees. Afterwards, he presented the palm tree to the Prophet, who then gave it to the poor man and his children. Vv. 15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16 refer to the man who refused to exchange his date palm for the promise of a tree in Paradise, while <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1525" title="1525"/>vv. 18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21 refer to the man who purchased the tree and gave it as charity (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). If, however, this is an early Makkan <i>sūrah,</i> as some maintain, then the story would most likely not refer to such an incident, but would be a more general condemnation of those who did not accept Muhammad as a prophet.</p>
092/016: who denies and turns away.
092/017: And the most reverent shall be removed from it,
092/018: who gives his wealth to purify,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">18</span><span class="hide">  </span>The implication is that one purifies both oneself and one’s wealth when one gives charity in the Name of God. <i>To purify</i> translates <i>tazakkā,</i> which is etymologically related to the Quranic word for alms, <i>zakāh</i>. Some believe that the whole of this <i>sūrah</i> is related to the story of the date palm mentioned in the previous comment, but others say that vv. 18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21 were revealed about the first Caliph, Abū Bakr al-<span class="HCSQ">Ṣ</span>iddīq, who used to buy weak slaves and then free them. When his father asked him, “Why do you not buy slaves who can defend you?” Abū Bakr responded, “It is not my defense that I seek,” and so vv. 17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21 were revealed extolling his generosity (IK, Q, W).</p>
092/019: not recompensing any for a favor thereby;
092/020: save for seeking the Face of his Lord, the Most High,
092/021: and surely he shall be content.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21</span><span class="hide">  </span>One account of the revelation of these verses states that, upon embracing Islam, Bilāl, who was a slave of one <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abd Allāh ibn Judan, proceeded to the idols of the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah and defecated on them. The idolaters complained to his master about what Bilāl had done and so he gave them Bilāl along with one hundred camels to be sacrificed to their gods. The idolaters took Bilāl and tortured him in the scorching desert. All he said while being tortured was “One! One!” as a testimony to the Oneness of God. The Prophet came upon this and said to him, “The One will save you!” He then informed Abū Bakr, saying, “Bilāl is being tortured for the sake of God!” Abū Bakr took with him a pound of gold and bought Bilāl. The idolaters said, “Abū Bakr did what he did only because he is obliged to Bilāl for a favor,” and so God revealed vv. 19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21 (W). Bilāl later became the first to lead the call to prayer (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>adhān</i>) and one of the Prophet’s personal treasurers.</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">19</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse literally reads, “no one having with him any favor to be repaid.” In both translations the implication is that one is neither recompensing others for favors done in the past, nor expecting recompense from anyone in the future for what one does at present, but spending in charity only out of desire to do God’s Will.</p>


093/001: By the morning brightness,
093/002: and by the night when still,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2</span><span class="hide">  </span>In addition to some interpretations given in the introduction, <i>the morning brightness</i> (<i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i>) is understood here as a specific reference to the morning (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i>) on which God spoke to Moses, and <i>the night</i> as a specific reference to the Night Journey and Ascension (see 17:1c; introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 53; Q, Sh); others say <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i> refers to the hour at which the sorcerers who opposed Moses recognized the truth of his message and fell prostrate (see 20:59; Sh). According to al-Shawkānī, when <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i> precedes the mention of night, as in this context, it refers to the entire day. It is also said that <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i> is the light of the Garden and <i>the night</i> is the darkness of the Fire (Sh), for the Fire of Hell is said to be without light; or that <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>u<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i> is the light within the hearts of those who know God (<i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ārifūn</i>) and that <i>the night</i> is the blackness of the hearts of the disbelievers. <i>When still</i> is said to refer to the darkness as it extends over the day (Sh). V. 2 is also interpreted to mean, “The night as it approaches” or “The night as it leaves” (Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
093/003: thy Lord has not forsaken thee; nor does He despise.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>See the introduction to this <i>sūrah</i>. This verse constitutes what is known as the response to the oath. Although most interpret the second-person singular (thee) to be the implied direct object of <i>despise,</i> it is not present in the Arabic text. It could thus be taken as a general statement that it is not in God’s Nature to despise.</p>
093/004: And the Hereafter shall be better for thee than this life.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse literally reads, “And the last shall be better for thee than the first.” Throughout the Quran the Abode of the Hereafter is considered better for human beings than the abode of this world (see also 16:30, 41; 28:60, 79<span class="HCSQ">–</span>80; 29:64; 40:39; 42:36; 43:35; 57:20<span class="HCSQ">–</span>21; 87:16<span class="HCSQ">–</span>17). As 13:26 maintains, <i>Compared to the Hereafter, the life of the world is but [fleeting] enjoyment.</i> The Quran thus criticizes those <i>who have purchased the world at the price of the Hereafter</i> (2:86; cf. 4:74). It is reported that when the Prophet was given the choice between remaining in this life until the end of time and then going to Paradise or moving on to the Hereafter, he chose being with God over life in this world (IK).</p>
093/005: And surely thy Lord shall give unto thee, and thou shalt be content.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Regarding the revelation of these verses, Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās reported that the Prophet said, “I have asked my Lord for something I wish I had not asked for. I said, ‘O my Lord! There were prophets before me, to some of whom you had subjugated the wind, [and he mentioned Solomon, son of David,] and some of whom could bring the dead back to life, [and he mentioned Jesus son of Mary,] and some of whom . . .’ God responded by saying, ‘Did I not find thee an orphan and shelter thee?’ I said, ‘Indeed, O my Lord.’ God said, ‘Did I not find thee astray and guide thee?’ I said, ‘Indeed, O my Lord.’ God said, ‘Did I not find thee in need and enrich thee?’ I said, ‘Indeed, O my Lord.’ God said, ‘Have I not caused thy breast to expand and lifted from thee thy burden? [see 94:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2].’ I said, ‘Indeed, O my Lord’” (Q, Sh, W).</p>
093/006: Did He not find thee an orphan and shelter,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>The Prophet was orphaned at an early age. His father, <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abd Allāh, died while his mother, Āminah, was pregnant with him, and his mother died when he was six years old. After this he was under the guardianship of his grandfather, <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abd al-Mu<span class="HCSQ">ṭ</span><span class="HCSQ">ṭ</span>alib, until he died when the Prophet was eight years old. Then his uncle, Abū <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>ālib, took responsibility for him and continued to protect him, assist him, and even restrain the people from harming him when he began to declare the message of the Quran. He also found great refuge in his marriage to Khadījah, who was his most ardent supporter when the revelations first began.</p>
093/007: find thee astray and guide,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be taken as reference to God’s teaching Muhammad his true nature as <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1528" title="1528"/>a messenger of God (Bg). Some understand this verse literally to mean that Muhammad had been astray and that God guided him to belief in the Oneness of God (<i>taw<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>īd</i>) and the reality of prophethood (<i>nubuwwah;</i> Bg). This reading is supported by verses such as 12:3: <i>We recount unto thee the most beautiful of stories by Our having revealed unto thee this Quran, though before it thou wert among the heedless.</i> For others, this verse means that the Prophet had strayed in the sense that he did not follow a revealed law or rite (<i>sharī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ah</i>), as none was known to his people, but not that he had strayed from belief in the Oneness of God (<i>taw<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>īd</i>). It can also be read as implying that, although he believed in the Oneness of God, he had no scripture and no direct guidance until the Quran was revealed. This reading is supported by 42:52: <i>Thus have We revealed unto thee a Spirit from Our Command. Thou knewest not what scripture was, nor faith. But We made it a light whereby We guide whomsoever We will among Our servants.</i> Some try to avoid the implication that the Prophet could have been astray in any religious or spiritual sense and read this verse as a reference to a time when the Prophet was lost in the streets of Makkah and God sent the Archangel Gabriel to guide him (Bg). Still others see it as a reference to a time when the Prophet was on a journey, his mount strayed from the road, and Gabriel came to set him back on the right course (Bg).</p>
093/008: and find thee in need and enrich?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some understand this verse as a reference to the Prophet’s enrichment through the wealth of his first wife, Khadījah (Bg). Others say it refers to the true wealth, which is spiritual contentment (see 58:22; 89:27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>28; 98:8), as in a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “Wealth comes not from abundance of goods; rather, wealth is the wealth of the soul” (Bg).</p>
093/009: So as for the orphan, scorn not.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span>On one level, this verse serves as a reminder from God that the Prophet should remember his own state as an orphan. On another level, it is an admonition to all of the Quraysh, because they were known to take the wealth of orphans and abuse their rights (Bg); see 89:17; 107:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2c. In the Madinan revelations, many instructions are given to <i>uphold justice for the orphans</i> (4:127), and Muslims are enjoined, <i>Approach not the orphan’s property, save in the best manner</i> (6:152; 17:34); see commentary on 4:2, 3, 6, 10. In this regard a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “The best house among the Muslims is a house in which an orphan has been treated well. And the worst house among the Muslims is a house in which an orphan has been treated poorly.” Then the Prophet pointed with his middle finger and his index finger and said, “I and the caretaker (<i>kāfil</i>) of an orphan are like this in the Garden” (Bg, Q), meaning that those who care for orphans will attain a high station and know the Prophet in Paradise.</p>
093/010: And as for one who requests, repel not.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10</span><span class="hide">  </span>An exhortation for mercy and kindness toward beggars in general, this verse is seen by most commentators as a specific reference to the beggar who comes to the door, who should either be fed or turned away gently without rebuke (Bg). It is also interpreted as an exhortation to share knowledge of the religion with anyone who seeks it (Bg, IK).</p>
093/011: And as for the blessing of thy Lord, proclaim!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is a command to the Prophet meaning, “Spread that with which God has blessed thee through thanks and praise” (Q). <i>The blessing of thy Lord</i> can refer to the Quran itself (Bg, Q, Sh), the gift of prophethood (<i>nubuwwah;</i> Bg, Q, Sh), the blessing of guidance after the mention of being astray (v. 7; Sh), or any blessing God has bestowed upon a person (Bg, Q). In this regard, the Prophet is reported to have said during a sermon, “Whosoever does not give thanks for that which is little is not thanked for that which is much. And whosever does not thank people does not thank God, and proclaiming [God’s] blessings is thanks, while abandoning it [i.e., proclaiming God’s Blessings] is disbelief (<i>kufr</i>)” (Bg, IK, Q, Sh, Sy). It is said that when this <i>sūrah</i> was revealed, the Prophet was joyous, proclaimed, “God is great (<i>Allāhu akbar</i>),” and counseled his followers to do the same whenever they read this <i>sūrah</i> (Bg, Q).</p>

094/001: Did We not expand for thee thy breast,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>The expansion of the breast relates to ease, especially in matters pertaining to religion, and is thus considered a characteristic of those who are rightly guided. This is particularly evident in the famous prayer of Moses when he received the call to prophethood: <i>My Lord! Expand for me my breast! Make my affair easy for me, and untie a knot from my tongue, that they may understand my speech</i> (20:25<span class="HCSQ">–</span>28). In contrast, the constriction or contraction of the breast is seen as a characteristic of those who are astray, as in 6:125: <i>Whomsoever God wishes to guide, He expands his breast for submission. And whomsoever He wishes to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow and constricted, as if he were climbing to the sky.</i> Those who are rightly guided can also experience straitening of the breast through trials and hardship. In this vein the verse can be seen as an allusion to God’s providing the Prophet with the patience and forbearance necessary to bear the insults of his enemies (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), as in 15:97: <i>And certainly We know that thy breast is straitened because of what they say.</i> This verse has also been seen as an allusion to the manner in which God expanded the Prophet’s breast and made his heart a container for the wisdom of the revelation (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>) or for prophethood and knowledge (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to some, this verse refers to the relief that came to the Prophet’s breast after a period of solitude on Mt. <span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>irā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>. According to others, it refers to the end of a period in which the revelation was said to have been interrupted (see introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 93). Still others read it as a reference to an episode in the Prophet’s youth when two angels opened his breast and removed a dark clot that is said to represent the root of malice and envy within the soul (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>).</p>
094/002: and lift from thee thy burden<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is seen by many commentators as an allusion to the Prophet’s being forgiven all sins (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), as in 48:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2: <i>Truly We have granted thee a manifest victory, that God may forgive thee thy sins that went before and that which is to come, and complete His Blessing upon thee, and guide thee upon a straight path</i> (IK, Sh).</p>
094/003: that weighed heavily upon thy back?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Weighed heavily</i> (<i>anqa<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>a</i>) implies something pushing down so hard that one’s back makes a sound (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>). Some say this verse refers to God’s lightening the burden of prophethood (Sh). Vv. 2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3 can also be seen as a reference to the lifting of the burden of ignorance and confusion, said to have afflicted Arabia, through the revelation of God’s edicts and decrees (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>).</p>
094/004: And did We not elevate thy renown?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>The Prophet’s renown was elevated when he was given the title “Messenger of God” (a title connected with the Name of God) and placed in the testimony of faith, “I bear witness that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God” (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Q, Sh), versions of which are recited in the call to prayer and in the greeting recited silently at the end of each prayer cycle (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). The Prophet’s title is also closely connected to the Name of God in other verses of the Quran (e.g., 4:13, 59; 9:26). The strongest indicator of the Prophet’s great renown is in 33:56: <i>Truly God and His angels invoke blessings upon the Prophet. O you who believe! Invoke blessings upon him, and greetings of peace!</i> According to some it is such blessings to which v. 4 refers (Sh). Others say that this verse refers to the mention of the Prophet Muhammad in previous scriptures (Sh).</p>
094/005: For truly with hardship comes ease!
094/006: Truly with hardship comes ease!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses can be read as indicating that enduring hardship with patience results in ease in this life and the Hereafter. A well-known <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “One instance of hardship (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>usr</i>) will never overcome two instances of ease (<i>yusrayn</i>)” (Āl, IK, Q, Sh, Sy). Also see, 65:7: <i>God tasks no soul beyond that which He has given it. <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1531" title="1531"/>God will bring ease after hardship;</i> and 2:185: <i>God desires ease for you, and He does not desire hardship for you</i>.</p>
094/007: So when thou art free, exert thyself;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>Or, “So when thou art relieved [of thy burden], toil,” meaning that after completing the obligatory devotions, one should supplicate the Lord and perform supererogatory devotions (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, JJ, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), or when free from worldly affairs, one should pray (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Or, “So when thou art devoted [to God], exert thyself,” meaning that one should always seek to deepen one’s prayers. Or, “So when thou art spent, toil,” meaning one should never cease to strive in the way of God and cease to exert oneself more to do God’s Will. It can also be taken to mean, “When thou art free from striving against thine enemies, exert thyself in worshipping the Lord” (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
094/008: and let thy desire be for thy Lord.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is understood to mean, “Do not desire this world<span class="HCSQ">—</span>let your desire be for God alone” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). On the one hand, this is an exhortation to prayer; on the other, it is an exhortation to pray only to God and to do good deeds only to please God.</p>

095/001: By the fig and the olive,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>For most commentators, <i>the fig and the olive</i> refer to the fruits of the earth, by which God swears due to the blessing and benefits contained in them (Bg, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b). For others they have a symbolic value: <i>the fig</i> symbolizes the mosque (meaning place of prostration, as there would not have been a building for that purpose at the time of the revelation) in Damascus, which may be a reference to the “mosque” of Noah, where the Ark landed on Mt. Jūdī (see 11:44c), and <i>the olive</i> symbolizes “the Holy House,” that is, the “mosque” in Jerusalem (IK, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); or <i>the fig</i> refers to the mount on which Damascus is built, and <i>the olive,</i> the mount on which Jerusalem is built (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b); others say that they refer to the cities themselves (Q). Another interpretation takes <i>the fig</i> as a reference to the “mosque” of the <i>Companions of the Cave</i> (18:9) and <i>the olive</i> as a reference to the “mosque” in Jerusalem (Q), while yet another sees them as two mountains in the Levant (Q). Others say that <i>the fig</i> refers to <i>the leaves of the Garden</i> (7:22), with which Adam and Eve covered themselves, and <i>the olive</i> refers to the <i>blessed olive tree</i> in 24:35 (Q). This last interpretation could be seen as a symbolic foreshadowing of vv. 4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6 in that fig leaves allude to what is lowest in human beings, since they were used to cover their private parts, while the <i>blessed olive tree</i> is seen by many as the symbolic source of the human “light of understanding” or “intellect”; see 24:35c.</p>
095/002: by Mount Sinai,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to most commentators, <i>Mount Sinai</i> is also referred to by name in 23:20 and simply as <i>the Mount</i> (<i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">Ṭ</span>ūr</i>) in eight other verses (2:63, 93; 4:154; 19:52; 20:80; 28:29, 46; 52:1, though others say such verses do not necessarily refer to Mount Sinai; see 23:20c). It is also sworn by in 52:1. In 23:20 <i>saynā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span></i> is used for “Sinai,” but here the word is <i>sinīn,</i> which some say is actually taken from the Ethiopic for “beautiful” and in this context means “the blessed beautiful Mount” (Q, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Others say that it means every mountain upon which there are fruit-bearing trees (Q, Sh).</p>
095/003: and by this land made safe,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>In pre-Islamic Arabia Makkah was a refuge in which no fighting was allowed (see the introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 105); hence it was a secure land, or a <i>land made safe;</i> cf. 29:67: <i>Or have they not considered that We have made a secure sanctuary while people are snatched away all around them?</i> Some say that <i>the fig and the olive</i> (v. 1) is a reference to Jerusalem, where Jesus was sent, <i>Mount Sinai</i> is a reference to the place where God spoke to Moses, and <i>this land made safe</i> is a reference to the place where the Prophet Muhammad was sent (IK).</p>
095/004: truly We created man in the most beautiful stature,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse begins the response to the oath taken in vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3. It is one of the most emphatic affirmations of humanity’s exalted status, before which the angels were ordered, <i>Prostrate unto Adam</i> (2:34; 7:11; 17:61; 18:50; 20:116). Although the human being is made of clay, God declares in 38:72, <i>I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit.</i> Here <i>man</i> is taken to mean all of humanity, male and female, believer and disbeliever alike. <i>Taqwīm,</i> translated <i>stature,</i> is a verbal noun from the verb <i>qawwama,</i> “to raise, shape, form, or arrange.” Here it is taken to indicate something that has become what it truly ought to be by achieving harmony and balance (R). An indication of this stature is that the human being stands upright while every other creature is created <i>with his face stooped down</i> (67:22; Āl, Q, R, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Yet <i>the most beautiful stature</i> is not taken as a reference simply to the human physical form, since the physical is also a symbol of “inner comportment,” as human beings are “the best of God’s <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1534" title="1534"/>creation both outwardly and inwardly” (Q), as expressed in a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth qudsī,</i> “Truly God created Adam in His image” (Āl, Q, Sh; cf. Genesis 1:27). This <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> is understood to mean that human beings are created with such attributes as life, knowledge, power, will, speech, hearing, and sight (the qualities most often used in Islamic theology to describe God), which are in fact Divine Attributes that God has caused to be reflected in human beings (Q). Human beings are able to manifest all of the Divine Names and Qualities, whereas all other created beings are only able to manifest a limited range of the Divine Names and Qualities (see 2:31c). “For this reason the philosophers say that [man] is a microcosm, since all that makes up created entities is gathered within him” (Q). Verses such as 30:8 and 51:21 can be seen as a call to human beings to reflect upon their exalted status and live in accord with it. When vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3 are taken as a reference to the locations of revelation, that human beings are created <i>in the most beautiful stature</i> can be seen as a reference to that aspect of their nature that is receptive to revelation.</p>
095/005: then We cast him to the lowest of the low,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>With regard to the outward human form, this verse can be seen as a reference to old age, when faculties are diminished, sometimes to the point of decrepitude (IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), similar to 36:68: <i>And whomsoever We give long life, We cause him to regress in creation</i> (see also 16:70). With regard to the inner reality, it can be taken as a reference to human beings falling below their true nature and consequently being cast into the Fire (Āl, IK, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); such people are the lowest of creation for failing to fulfill the requirements of being created <i>in the most beautiful stature</i> (Āl). In this vein, <i>the lowest of the low</i> can be understood as a reference to the state of disbelievers, of whom 7:179 says, <i>Such as these are like cattle. Nay, they are even further astray,</i> or as a reference to the place in which they will be cast (Āl).</p><p class="indent">According to some, <i>the lowest of the low</i> should be read “the lowest, lowly,” with “lowly” (<i>sāfilīn</i>) referring to the state of abasement experienced by those who are cast down and implying that their own condition has condemned them.</p>
095/006: save those who believe and perform righteous deeds; for theirs shall be a reward unceasing.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse makes it more likely that the preceding verse refers to the inner reality of human beings. <i>A reward unceasing</i> (cf. 41:8; 68:3; 84:25) is one that is never decreased or cut off in this life or the next (R). Regarding this world, it is said to refer to the fact that if people maintain religious practice, they continue to receive reward for required acts of worship even when sickness renders them unable to perform them or travel causes them to shorten prayers or break the fast (Āl, Q), as is permitted under Islamic Law. Regarding the next world, it refers to the bounties of Heaven.</p>
095/007: What then will make you deny religion?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>As translated, this verse is a question posed to those who deny the revelation, the Resurrection, and other aspects of religion. It may also be addressing belief in the Prophet specifically, as if to say, “Who would deny thee, O Messenger, after the appearance of these proofs of religion” (Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), though this reading is considered grammatically problematic by some (Āl). The verse also indicates amazement that anyone could witness human beings coming from a drop (see 16:4; 18:37; 22:5; 35:11; 36:77; 40:67; 53:46; 75:37; 76:2; 80:19) and rising to <i>the most beautiful stature,</i> yet still deny the Resurrection (Āl, Q, R).</p>
095/008: Is not God the most just of judges?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 6:57: <i>Judgment belongs to God alone; He relates the Truth, and He is the best of deciders;</i> 11:45. God is also referred to as <i>the best</i> (or <i>most just</i>) <i>of judges</i> (7:87; 10:109; 12:80). In relation to the preceding verses, the implication is that human beings differ, because some leave the state of <i>the most beautiful stature</i> and descend to <i>the lowest of the low,</i> while others remain in <i>the most beautiful stature,</i> and it is only logical that they would differ in recompense according to God’s <i>most just</i> judgment (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>b). As the Prophet is commanded to say in another verse, <i>God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein you used to differ</i> (22:69). This is in reference to the great difference between believers and disbelievers, and the good and the wicked indicated in several verses (e.g., 5:100; 6:51; 13:16; 32:18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>22; 35:19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>22; 38:28; 39:9; 40:58; 59:20).</p>

096/001: Recite in the Name of thy Lord Who created,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>For the account of the revelation of these verses, see the introduction to this <i>sūrah</i>. These verses begin by discussing creation; the first mention of creation in v. 1 can be taken as a reference to the fact that God creates all that exists from nothing (Aj). The passage then moves to the creation of the human being, who is honored and ennobled through knowledge, the faculty that distinguished Adam from the angels (IK). The creation of the human being and knowledge are related in the first revelation, because human beings are created for knowledge of God and His creation, and God teaches Adam and thus all humanity the names of all things (2:31) before commanding, providing laws, and judging. According to some, the mention of recitation precedes that of writing because, although both are means of conveying knowledge, there could be speech without writing, but not writing without speech (IK). Thus although <i>recite</i> could also be translated “read,” <i>recite</i> is the better option because the Prophet was not given something to read and is reported to have been “unlettered” (see 62:2c).</p>
096/002: created man from a blood clot.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Several verses refer to different periods of gestation as a sign of God’s creative power. The <i>blood clot</i> appears to be the third stage in the most extensive Quranic account of gestation: <i>O mankind! If you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, [remember] We created you from dust, then from a drop, then from a blood clot, then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed, that We may make clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for a term appointed</i> (22:5). For the stages that follow the clot, see 23:14; 40:67c; 75:38. Vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2 can also be seen as a commentary on 95:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5, where <i>created</i> in v. 1 refers to creating <i>man in the most beautiful stature</i> (95:4) and v. 2 refers to casting <i>him to the lowest of the low</i> (95:5).</p>
096/003: Recite! Thy Lord is most noble,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Or, “Recite, for thy Lord is most noble.” In pre-Islamic Arabia nobility or magnanimity (<i>karāmah</i>) was considered the highest of all virtues, implying an unblemished pedigree, all virtuous character traits, and unbounded generosity; see 49:13c. In accord with the third quality, this verse could also be understood to mean, “Recite, for thy Lord is most generous,” for He blesses human beings with the greatest of blessings (Aj), creation and revelation. In pre-Islamic poetry, <i>karīm,</i> meaning “noble” or “generous,” was said of people, but not of God. The Quranic usage of the term thus introduced an aspect of God hitherto unknown to the pagan Arabs.</p>
096/004: Who taught by the Pen,
096/005: taught man that which he knew not.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>That God teaches human beings and brings them <i>out of darkness into light</i> (14:1, 5; 33:43; 57:9; cf. Isaiah 42:16; 1 Peter 2:9) is the extension and continuation of His unbounded generosity. Some say that pens are of three principal types: the first, corresponding to the Logos or Intellect, is the one that God commanded to write all that would be until the Day of Resurrection; the second are those with which the angels record the deeds of human beings (see commentary on 18:49; 82:10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12); and the third are those with which human beings write (Q). According to some, <i>man</i> indicates Adam, of whom 2:31 says, <i>and He taught Adam the names, all of them</i> (Q). Others say that it indicates the Prophet Muhammad, as in 4:113: <i>God has sent down unto thee the Book and Wisdom, and has taught thee what thou knewest not; God’s Bounty toward thee is great indeed</i> (Q). But here most commentators take <i>taught man</i> to mean that this verse refers to the manner in which God teaches all human beings, not only prophets. God’s teaching <i>by the Pen</i> can also be seen as an allusion to the Divine Intellect inscribing knowledge upon the tablet of the human soul. For more on the symbolism of the pen, see 68:1c.</p>
096/006: Nay, truly man is rebellious<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses were reportedly revealed several years after vv. 1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5 in reference to Abū Jahl, the leader of the Quraysh, who rejected the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1538" title="1538"/>prophethood of Muhammad and tried to hinder the practice of Islam (Aj, IK, Q).</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>The use of the emphatic particle <i>nay</i> (<i>kallā</i>) here implies that despite the great blessings of creation and of knowledge, people deny them and are unthankful for them; thus they are disbelievers and rebels (Aj). In this context, <i>rebellious</i> can thus be seen as an allusion to those who rebel against what God teaches.</p>
096/007: in that he considers himself beyond need.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Beyond need</i> is literally “self-sufficient,” but <i>beyond need</i> better conveys the negative connotation of viewing oneself as “self-sufficient” vis-à-vis God. Such self-sufficiency can then be seen as the root of all rebelliousness (Aj).</p>
096/008: Truly unto thy Lord is the return.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>The return to God is among the most central themes of the Quran; see commentary on 2:156: <i>Truly we are God’s, and unto Him we return.</i></p>
096/009: Hast thou seen him who prohibits
096/010: a slave when he prays?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses are usually understood as a direct reference to Abū Jahl’s preventing the Prophet from praying at the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah (Aj, IK, Q).</p>
096/011: Hast thou seen if he does so out of guidance,
096/012: or to enjoin reverence?
096/013: Hast thou seen if he denied and turned away?
096/014: Does he not know that God sees?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses are taken as a rebuke to Abū Jahl (IK, Q), meaning, “Do you have the capacity to judge whether the Prophet is guided?” This particular referent does not, however, contravene the general castigation of all who question the veracity of the Prophet and the Quran. Although some take vv. 13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14 as a continuation of the admonishment in vv. 11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>12, in which case <i>he</i> continues to refer to the Prophet, others see the referent as Abū Jahl (Q).</p>
096/015: Nay, but if he ceases not, We shall surely seize him by the forelock<span class="HCSQ">—</span>
096/016: a lying, iniquitous forelock.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">15<span class="HCSQ">–</span>16</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses are taken by most as an answer to v. 14, meaning that Abū Jahl did not know that God sees. Thus Abū Jahl would not cease to attempt to prohibit the Prophet from praying. The application is nonetheless general, as in 55:41: <i>The guilty shall be known by their marks; and they shall be seized by the forelocks and by the feet.</i> From a Quranic perspective, <i>there is no creature that crawls, but that He holds it by its forelock</i> (11:56).</p>
096/017: So let him call his cohorts.
096/018: We shall call the guards of Hell.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>18</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Cohorts</i> is seen by most as a reference to the other members of the Quraysh who supported Abū Jahl. According to Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās, the Prophet was praying when Abū Jahl came to him and said, “Did we not warn you about this?” The Prophet went to him and reproached him. Abū Jahl retaliated by saying, “Indeed, you know very well that there is no one in Makkah who has more guards than me,” and as a response God revealed vv. 17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>18. Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās is said to have commented, “By God, had he called, God would have sent the guards of Hell against him” (Aj, IK, Q).</p>
096/019: Nay! Obey him not! But prostrate and draw nigh.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">19</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Nay</i> is either another rebuke to Abū Jahl or an address directly to the Prophet and his followers indicating that they should pay no heed to Abū Jahl and his threats, and persist in prostrating to God. <i>Obey him not</i> is echoed in 68:8: <i>So obey not the deniers.</i> More generally, these verses can be taken as an indication that people should not heed any who deny religion or the efficacy of prayer and should continue to <i>prostrate and draw nigh</i> through prayer, for that is the means by which one draws closer to God. According to a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “The closest that a servant can be to his Lord is when he is prostrating” (IK, Q; for the spiritual significance of prostration, see 32:15c; 19:58c).</p><p class="indent">This verse is one of fifteen verses after the recitation of which one is enjoined to prostrate; see 19:58c.</p>

097/001: Truly We sent it down in the Night of Power.
097/002: And what shall apprise thee of the Night of Power?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>It</i> refers to the Quran. According to several commentators, these verses indicate that the Quran was revealed in its entirety at once (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). This is understood to be the first stage of revelation from the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> (85:22) to the lowest heaven, that of this world (Bg, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), or more specifically to the House of Might (<i>bayt al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>izzah</i>), which is in the lowest heaven (IK, Sh); see also 44:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5c. The second stage of revelation is then understood to have occurred gradually over a twenty-three-year period from 610 to 632. For a discussion of the second stage of revelation, see 17:106c; 25:32c. There are over forty interpretations of what is meant by <i>the Night of Power</i> (Sh). According to Mujāhid, it is “the night of <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ukm,</i>” “the night of judgment/decree” (Sh), meaning that on this night God decrees (<i>qaddara</i>) all things for the following year (Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), or meaning God’s Decree for the whole of creation, or both. Others do not see a necessary relation to God’s Decree, saying that this night is so named to convey its honor and greatness (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Others say that the name relates to the power of acts of obedience and worship performed during it, which have “a great power and a tremendous reward” (see the introduction to the <i>sūrah;</i> Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). The rhetorical question in v. 2 is an emphatic expression of the utter holiness of this night, implying that true knowledge of it is beyond human understanding and belongs only to God (Sh).</p>
097/003: The Night of Power is better than a thousand months.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>The merit for acts of worship performed during this night is greater than that for those performed during a thousand other months (R, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Here and in other verses (e.g., 22:47; 32:5), <i>a thousand</i> need not be taken literally, but as emphasis. According to some, the meaning of <i>a thousand months</i> is “all time” (Sh).</p>
097/004: The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the leave of their Lord, with every command;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 44:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4. On this night the angels descend to bless and bring peace to the believers, although many <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ādīth</i> affirm that this function is not restricted to this night, but only more effulgent in it. Most interpret <i>the Spirit</i> as a reference to the Archangel Gabriel, who is the angel of revelation (IK, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); others say it is a reference to a type of angel, those who are the most noble of them (Sh), which some say are the angels <i>at the lote tree of the boundary</i> (see 53:14<span class="HCSQ">–</span>15c; Āl, R); others say this verse refers to a special group of angels whose only function is to descend on this night (Aj, Āl, Sh); still others say <i>the Spirit</i> refers to another archangel. It can also be seen as a reference to God’s Mercy (<i>ra<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>mah;</i> Aj, Āl, Sh); also see the discussion of “Spirit” (<i>rū<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span></i>) in 78:38c. <i>Therein</i> (<i>fīhā</i>) could also be taken to mean “among them,” meaning that <i>the Spirit</i> descends with the angels (Āl). <i>By the leave of their Lord</i> is interpreted by some to mean “by the Command of their Lord” (Sh), as in 19:64, where the angels say, <i>We descend not, save by the Command of thy Lord</i> (R). <i>With every command,</i> or “with every decree,” has many interpretations. The most prevalent is that it means on account of everything that God has ordained (<i>qa<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>ā</i>) for the following year (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); see 44:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5c. An alternate reading of this verse is <i>min kulli imri<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>in,</i> meaning, “for every human being” (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
097/005: peace it is until the break of dawn.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>Many say this verse refers to greetings of <i>peace</i> that the angels bestow upon those who spend this night in prayer (IK, R, Sh). Others say it indicates that this night itself is naught but peace (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Sh), which is interpreted to mean that there is no evil in this night whatsoever (Āl, IK, R). Some say it indicates that there is peace in everything that God decrees or ordains for the following year during this night (Āl). It can also be seen as conveying the pregnant quietude that precedes the emergence of the Divine Word in the human world and by analogy the stillness of heart required for the true remembrance of God.</p>

098/001: Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book and the idolaters will not desist until the clear proof comes unto them,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some commentators consider this verse to be among the most difficult verses of the Quran (Sh, W). According to most commentators, <i>those who disbelieve among the People of the Book</i> refers to disbelievers among both Jews and Christians (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, IK, Q, Sh), though some say it refers only to the Jews of Madinah (Q). Most read this verse to mean that disbelievers will not leave their disbelief until <i>the clear proof</i> of revelation has come to them (Q, R, Sh, Z). Others say that it could mean that they will not be punished or destroyed until the proof of revelation has been brought to them (Sh); in which case <i>the idolaters will not desist</i> could be translated “the idolaters will not be abandoned,” meaning that God will send them <i>the clear proof</i> and they will then be rewarded or punished based upon their acceptance or rejection of it. This interpretation accords with many passages confirming that God will not punish any for wrong belief until they have been presented with the truth and then rejected it, as in 17:15: <i>And never do We punish till We have sent a messenger</i> (see 79:18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19c). In this vein, the verse can be seen as a specific reference to disbelief in the prophethood of Muhammad (Q), not necessarily to disbelief in God. Most interpret <i>the clear proof</i> as a reference to the Quran (Q, R, Sh), as in 6:57: <i>Truly I stand upon a clear proof from my Lord, and you have denied Him.</i> Others take <i>clear proof</i> as a reference to the Prophet Muhammad (Q, R, Sh). But it can also be seen as a reference to the phenomena of revelation and thus to the books and prophets sent to all communities, since the dozens of references to <i>clear proof(s)</i> throughout the Quran are used in relation to many different prophets and the books with which they were sent (see the introduction to this <i>sūrah</i>). In this interpretation, disbelievers among <i>the People of the Book</i> refers to those who are said to have altered the scriptures that had been sent to them through previous prophets; see 2:75c; 3:78c.</p>
098/002: a messenger from God reciting scriptures purified,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>The majority of commentators interpret <i>scriptures purified</i> as a reference to the Quran and <i>a messenger</i> as a reference to Muhammad (Bg, IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). <i>Messenger</i> can, however, also be read as a reference to the Archangel Gabriel (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>), and both terms could be seen as references to the messengers and revelations that each community has been sent, since, as several verses attest, <i>there has been no community but that a warner has passed among them</i> (35:24). <i>Scriptures purified</i> can also be read as a reference to the <i>Preserved Tablet</i> (85:22; Sh), from which all revelation is said to descend; see 85:22c; 97:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2c.</p>
098/003: wherein are books upright.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Books upright</i> indicates that they are free from errors and mistakes because they are from God (IK, Sh), distinguishing between truth and falsehood with <i>no crookedness therein</i> (18:1; R), since they are <i>on pages honored, exalted and purified</i> (80:13<span class="HCSQ">–</span>14; Q); see also 85:21<span class="HCSQ">–</span>22.</p>
098/004: Those who were given the Book did not become divided until after the clear proof had come unto them.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is similar to 45:17: <i>And We gave them clear proofs from the Command. And they differed not till after knowledge had come unto them, out of envy among themselves</i> (cf. 2:213; 3:19, 105; 10:93; 23:53; 43:63<span class="HCSQ">–</span>65). Given this tendency among human beings, 3:105 counsels, <i>Be not like those who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them.</i> From one perspective, this means that people had been unified in their disbelief, but that after the clear proofs of revelation came, <i>they differed: among them were those who believed, and among them were those who disbelieved</i> (2:253). Others claim that it alludes to those among the People of the Book who believed that a messenger would come, but, when the Prophet Muhammad was sent, denied his prophethood, as in 2:89: <i>And when there came to them a Book from God, confirming that which <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1543" title="1543"/>they had with them—and aforetime they used to ask for victory over those who disbelieve—so when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it</i> (R). Others see this verse as a reference to the corruption of pure revelation by previous religious communities, who argued with one another and divided into different sects (<i>firqah;</i> IK), as in 11:110; 27:76; and 41:45. In this vein they cite a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “Verily, the Jews differed until they became seventy-one sects. And verily, the Christians differed until they became seventy-two sects. And this community [i.e., the Muslim community] will divide into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in the Fire except one.” The Prophet was then asked, “Who are they, O Messenger of God?” He replied, “[Those who follow] what I and my Companions follow” (IK, Q).</p>
098/005: They were not commanded but to worship God, devoting religion entirely to Him, as <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>anīf</i>s, and to perform the prayer, and to give the alms<span class="HCSQ">—</span>that is the upright religion.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>The first phrase is understood to mean that those who came before were only ordered to do that which was enjoined upon them in order to worship God (Sh, Z), and is taken to imply that they sought other objectives and mixed other practices and beliefs into the pure religion that God had sent them (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). <i>Devoting . . . entirely</i> translates <i>mukhli<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>,</i> which implies making something pure and doing something with complete sincerity. It can be taken to mean both that they purify the religion for God, meaning their practice and understanding of the religion, and that they purify themselves (Sh). <i><span class="HCSQIt">Ḥ</span>anīf</i> (pl. <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>unafā<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span></i>) derives from the verb <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>anifa,</i> meaning “to incline.” It is employed in the Quran to indicate one who inclines away from idolatry and toward belief in the Oneness of God (<i>taw<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>īd</i>). Abraham is thus described as a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>anīf</i> in several verses (2:135; 3:67, 95; 4:125; 6:79, 161; 16:120, 123). And in 10:105, the Prophet is enjoined, <i>Set thy face toward the religion as a</i> <span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>anīf, <i>and be thou not among the idolaters;</i> see also 22:31; 30:30. For the meaning of <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>anīf,</i> see 2:135c. <i>Alms</i> translates <i>zakāh,</i> which is the technical term for the Muslim mandatory alms (see 2:277c), but is also used to indicate the alms mandated for previous religious communities (see 2:43, 83, 177, 277; 4:77, 162; 7:156; 19:31, 55; 21:73; 22:41; 24:37), and at other times for all forms of charitable giving. The root meaning of <i>zakāh</i> is purification, implying that giving wealth purifies both the giver and the wealth. In this context, <i>zakāh</i> can be more broadly conceived as all acts of kindness toward the poor and needy (IK), especially if this is a Makkan <i>sūrah</i> revealed before the formal institutionalization of the alms.</p><p class="indent"><i>The upright religion</i> is seen by some as a reference to the religion of Abraham and his followers, the religion that was taught in the <i>scriptures purified</i> (v. 2). For the meaning of <i>the upright religion,</i> see 30:30c. In this context some understand it as a direct reference to the religion with which the Prophet Muhammad was sent (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), while others see it as a more general reference to all those who follow what has been revealed to them through a prophet.</p>
098/006: Truly the disbelievers among the People of the Book and the idolaters are in the Fire of Hell, abiding therein; it is they who are the worst of creation.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8</span><span class="hide">  </span>That human beings can be both <i>the best of creation</i> and <i>the worst of creation</i> testifies to their unique place in the cosmos, as in 95:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5: <i>Truly We created man in the most beautiful stature, then We cast him to the lowest of the low</i>. On the one hand, human beings are favored above all else, as in 17:70: <i>We have indeed honored the <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1544" title="1544"/>Children of Adam, and We carry them over land and sea, and provide them with good things, and We have favored them above many We have created.</i> On the other hand, when they do not live up to their potential, they are below all else, as in 25:44: <i>Truly they are but as cattle. Nay, they are further astray from the way.</i> Vv. 6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7 can also be taken as a reference to those who are the worst or the best of the age in which they live, as in 2:47, which addresses the Children of Israel, <i>Remember My Blessing which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above the worlds</i> (Q). According to both Shiite and Sunni sources, the Prophet said to <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Alī ibn Abī <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>ālib regarding <i>the best of creation,</i> “That is you and your partisans (<i>shī<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ah</i>) on the Day of Resurrection, <i>content, contenting</i> [89:28]” (Kā, Sh, Sy).</p><p class="indent">The combination of <i>the best of creation</i> and the mutual contentment mentioned in v. 8 indicates that human beings have an illustrious station (IK). Based upon these and other verses, some scholars have argued that believing and righteous human beings are better than the angels (Āl, IK). Others see an allusion to believers as the best among the created beings in this world. Regarding the latter, the Prophet is reported to have said to some Companions, “Shall I not inform you of <i>the best of creation</i>?” They said, “Of course, O Messenger of God!” He replied, “A man who takes the reins of his horse in the way of God, and whenever there is a cry from the enemy, he mounts it. Shall I not inform you of <i>the best of creation</i>?” They said, “Of course, O Messenger of God!” He said, “A man who has a flock of sheep, and he establishes the prayer and gives alms. Shall I not inform you of <i>the worst of creation</i>?” They said, “Of course.” He said, “The person who is asked for the sake of God (<i>bi<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span> Llāh</i>), yet does not give for His sake” (IK, Sh). According to another <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> “The believer is more noble in the Eyes of God than some of His angels” (Q).</p>
098/007: Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds, it is they who are the best of creation.
098/008: Their reward is with their Lord, Gardens of Eden with rivers running below, abiding therein forever, God being content with them and they being content with Him. That is for whosoever fears his Lord.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>For <i>God being content with them and they being content with Him,</i> see also 5:119; 9:100; 58:22c; 89:28c. According to some, the Garden of Contentment (<i>jannat al-ri<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>wān</i>) is the second highest level of Paradise, just below the Garden of the Essence (<i>jannat al-dhāt</i>).</p>

099/001: When the earth is shaken with her shaking,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>The <i>shaking</i> of the earth is considered to be one of the signs of the Hour (cf. 19:90; 27:88; 56:4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6; 69:14; 73:14; 89:21). Many other verses also refer to the distress that human beings will experience when the world comes to an end (e.g., 22:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2).</p>
099/002: and the earth yields up her burdens,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is similar to 84:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4: <i>And when the earth is stretched out, and casts forth what is in it, emptying itself</i> (cf. 54:7; 101:4). A <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says of this event, “The earth will throw out the pieces of its liver [i.e., its contents]. Gold and silver will come out like columns. A murderer will come and say, ‘I killed for this!’ The one who broke the ties of kinship will say, ‘For this I severed the ties of kinship!’ The thief will say, ‘For this I had my hands amputated!’ Then they will leave it there, and no one will take anything from it” (IK).</p>
099/003: and man says, “What ails her?”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be seen as a reference to all human beings who are alive when this event occurs or only to the disbelievers (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Q, Sh). With regard to the latter, the believers know that the world is ephemeral, whereas the disbelievers will be astonished when it fades away.</p>
099/004: That Day she shall convey her chronicles;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>The earth will speak of what its inhabitants did while upon it. It is reported that the Prophet said, “Verily, <i>her chronicles</i> means that she will testify against every male and female servant, about what they did upon her surface.

099/005: for thy Lord inspired her.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>The earth is <i>inspired</i> or instructed to <i>convey</i> all of the deeds performed by those who dwelled upon her.</p>
099/006: That Day mankind shall issue forth upon diverse paths to witness their deeds.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Upon diverse paths</i> translates <i>ashtātan,</i> implying that people’s ends will diverge greatly and thus alluding to the contrast between those destined for Heaven and those destined for Hell. <i>Ashtātan</i> could also be taken to imply that they are dispersed and scattered, as in 101:4: <i>A day wherein mankind shall be like scattered moths</i> (see also 54:7). Though on the Day of Judgment people are said to stand in groups according to their particular religious communities (see 16:84, 89; 28:75; 36:69), every person will be resurrected alone and stand in judgment alone, with none of the things people rely upon in this life or thought they might be able to rely upon in the Hereafter. See 6:94: <i>And [God will say], “Now you have come unto Us alone, just as We created you the first time, and you have left behind that which We had bestowed upon you. We see not with you your intercessors—those whom you claimed were partners [unto God]. Now the bond between you has been severed, and that which you once claimed has forsaken you.”</i></p>
099/007: So whosoever does a mote’s weight of good shall see it.
099/008: And whosoever does a mote’s weight of evil shall see it.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 34:3: <i>Not a mote’s weight evades Him in the heavens or on earth, nor smaller than that, nor larger, but that it is in a clear Book</i> (cf. 10:61; 54:52<span class="HCSQ">–</span>53). According to Muqātil ibn Sulaymān, one of the earliest Quran commentators, “These two verses were revealed about two men. One of them deemed it unworthy to give beggars one date, a small piece of bread, or one walnut, saying to himself, ‘Such things are nothing. We only get rewarded when we give away something that we love.’ The other man used to belittle minor sins such as small lies, backbiting, and looking at that which is unlawful, saying to himself, ‘No onus is upon me because of engaging in this, for God only threatens those who commit major sins with <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1547" title="1547"/>Hellfire.’ And so God revealed these two verses, encouraging people to perform even small acts of goodness, since they add up in the end, and cautioning them against even small sins, since they add up in the end” (W). There are many <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ādīth</i> that reinforce this message, among them, “Fear the Fire, even if by giving half a date in charity, and even if by saying a single word of good” (IK). The Prophet’s wife <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>ishah is reported to have said, “He used to say, ‘O <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>ishah! Beware of the sins that are belittled, for indeed they will be taken account of by God’” (IK). That everything will be recorded <i>in a book</i> or <i>in a clear book</i> is reiterated in several verses (6:59; 10:61; 11:6; 20:52; 22:70; 27:75; 34:3; 35:11; 57:22; 78:29). Sometimes this record is understood as a reference to all deeds and at other times as a reference to all that exists. For a discussion of the book in which the deeds of human beings are recorded, see 18:49c and 69:19<span class="HCSQ">–</span>29.</p>

100/001: By the panting chargers,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to al-Bay<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>āwī, the oaths in these verses can also be seen as an allusion to “charging souls” who, when something of the light of holiness appears unto them, convey it to others, strike the sparks of spiritual knowledge (<i>al-ma<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ārif</i>), raid caprice and bad habits, raise desire for God, and finally penetrate altogether into the midst of those who are in <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Illiyyūn, considered by some to be the highest Garden of Paradise (see 83:18<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19).</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>The various occasions of revelation reported imply that this verse refers to either horses in battle or camels on the pilgrimage (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>), but it can be seen as applying to both, as each is understood as fulfilling a function considered worthy of being sworn upon by God.</p>

100/006: truly man is ungrateful to his Lord,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse constitutes the response to the oaths in the first five verses. <i>Kanūd,</i> here translated <i>ungrateful,</i> indicates a land where nothing grows or a person who is petty and miserly.</p>
100/007: and truly he is a witness to that,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>He</i> can be read as a reference to either God or human beings (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). God as Witness is attested in many other verses (3:98; 4:33; 5:117; 22:17; 33:55; 58:6; 85:9). As to the latter, it can be taken to imply either that human beings are aware of their sins in this life or that they will be aware of them on the Day of Judgment, as in 67:11: <i>Thus do they admit their sin</i> (see also 35:37; 42:35). Other verses attest that on the Day of Judgment people will be made to testify against themselves (6:30; 24:24; 36:65; 41:20); see 36:65c.</p>
100/008: and truly he is fierce in his love for good things.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most commentators equate <i>good things</i> with wealth, but the term can also be seen as a more general reference to all things of this world for which human beings have excessive love at the expense of loving God and the blessings of the Hereafter, as in 3:14: <i>Made to seem fair unto mankind is the love of passions, among them women, children, hoarded heaps of gold and silver, horses of mark, cattle, and tillage. Those are the enjoyment of the life of this world. And God, with Him is the beautiful return.</i></p>
100/009: Does he not know that when what lies within graves is turned inside out,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">9</span><span class="hide">  </span>All human beings will be resurrected (see also 82:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4; 84:3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4; 99:2c). The image of graves being turned inside out is another example of apocalyptic inversion (see, e.g., 81:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6; 82:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4) that evokes the idea of all one’s past being resurrected for judgment (cf. 35:22; 60:13).</p>

100/011: truly on that Day their Lord shall be aware of them!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">10<span class="HCSQ">–</span>11</span><span class="hide">  </span>On the Day of Resurrection the good will be clearly distinguished from the bad (Sh), and the true nature of all actions and hearts will be known. The Day of Judgment is thus referred to in 86:9 as <i>the Day when secrets are tested,</i> for on this day everyone’s true nature will become known. As dozens of verses attest, God is at all times aware of all that human beings do (e.g., 2:134, 221; 3:153, 180; 17:30; 24:30; 27:88; 57:11) and <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1550" title="1550"/>of <i>what lies within breasts</i> (cf. 3:119, 154; 5:7; 8:43; 11:5; 31:23; 35:38; 39:7; 42:24; 57:6; 64:4; 67:13). The specific reference to God’s Awareness on the Day of Judgment in this verse can thus be understood as an indication that on this day human beings will themselves become cognizant of the fact of God’s ever present awareness and will no longer be able to deceive themselves or deny the intentions that lay behind their actions. In other verses, the disbelievers even bear witness that they deserve Hellfire (see 39:71; 67:11).</p>

101/001: The calamity;

101/003: And what shall apprise thee of the calamity?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Calamity</i> translates <i>qāri<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ah,</i> which comes from the verb <i>qara<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a,</i> meaning, “to beat or strike something so that it makes a deafening sound.” The repetition of the question in vv. 2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3 (which is similar to 69:2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3) is meant to emphasize that the true nature of the calamity, which is thought to be the Day of Judgment, is difficult if not impossible to comprehend. Thus the following verses do not define <i>the calamity,</i> but describe some of its marks.</p>
101/004: A day wherein mankind shall be like scattered moths,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Like scattered moths</i> indicates that human beings will be bewildered, running to and fro with no direction, as if they were <i>drunk, though drunk they will not be</i> (22:2). This is similar to 54:7: <i>With their eyes humbled they emerge from the graves as if they were scattered locusts</i> (cf. 99:6), though 54:7 refers to the Resurrection, while the present verse most likely refers to the end of time. As the present verse is in the accusative in Arabic, there is an implied word before the sentence, which could be a command to the Prophet, such as “Mention” (<i>udhkur;</i> Āl), or a verb following upon the previous verse, such as “strike” (<i>qara<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a;</i> Z), meaning, “It strikes on a day when . . .”</p>
101/005: and the mountains shall be like carded wool.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 70:9. Several verses speak of mountains made firm (e.g., 13:3; 16:15; 21:31; 41:10) as one of the signs of God. But on the Day of Judgment, <i>the mountains are set in motion</i> (81:3), <i>scattered</i> (77:10), and are <i>like heaps of shifting sand</i> (73:14); see also 18:47; 19:90; 20:105<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6; 27:88; 52:10; 56:5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6c; 69:14.</p>

101/009: an abyss shall be his mother.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9</span><span class="hide">  </span>Cf. 7:8; 23:102. <i>Scales</i> are <i>heavy</i> with good deeds. <i>Mawāzīn,</i> here translated <i>scales</i> is the plural of <i>mīzān,</i> which elsewhere is translated <i>balance</i> (6:152; 7:85; 11:84<span class="HCSQ">–</span>85; 42:17; 55:7<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9; 57:25). <i>Balance</i> (<i>mīzān</i>) is employed in the Quran to indicate revelation itself and the establishment of a just order that accords with what has been revealed (see 57:25c), whereas <i>scales</i> (<i>mawāzīn</i>) is employed in relation to the measuring of one’s deeds on the Day of Resurrection (see 21:47). The plural, <i>scales,</i> speaks to how each individual will experience the weighing of his or her deeds, but according to most, it is in fact one scale, hence one <i>balance,</i> in which all deeds are weighed (Āl). From a Quranic perspective, <i>the good deed and the evil deed are not equal</i> (41:34), and <i>good deeds remove those that are evil</i> (11:114). Good deeds thus significantly outweigh evil deeds, as in 6:160: <i>Whosoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof; but whosoever brings an evil deed shall be recompensed only with the like thereof.</i> But it is the character and intention behind deeds that establish their true weight. Regarding character, a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “There is nothing placed in the Balance that is heavier than goodness of character (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>usn al-khuluq</i>).” Regarding intention, another <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “Deeds are only in accord with their intentions. And every person has only what he intended.” From one perspective, although all deeds will be weighed, it is nonetheless through God’s Mercy that salvation occurs, for God is not bound by human actions. As a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “None of you will enter Paradise by his deeds.” Someone asked, “Not even you, O Messenger of God?” He said, “Not even me, save that God shelter me with His Mercy.” For <i>he shall enjoy a <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1553" title="1553"/>life contenting,</i> cf. 69:21. For <i>one whose scales are light,</i> cf. 7:9; 23:103.</p><p class="indent"><i>Mother</i> translates <i>umm,</i> which derives from the verb <i>amma,</i> meaning, “to betake oneself to” or “direct one’s course to.” In this context it indicates that those who do not perform good deeds direct themselves to the <i>abyss</i> of Hell. In this sense it is similar to verses that speak of those who <i>wrong themselves</i> (e.g., 3:117; 7:177; 9:70; 10:44; 16:33, 118) and to those verses that refer to Hell and the Fire as the <i>refuge</i> of the disbelievers (e.g., 3:162, 197; 9:73; 13:18).</p>
101/010: And what shall apprise thee of her?
101/011: It is a raging fire.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">11</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is taken to mean that the Fire has reached the greatest heat possible (Sh) and that, when viewed in relation to this Fire, no other fire is truly <i>raging</i> (R).</p>

102/001: Vying for increase distracts you,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Vying for increase</i> in worldly gains <i>distracts</i> people from obedience to God and remembering the Hereafter (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). “Distraction” (<i>lahw</i>) indicates an amusement, something that keeps people from achieving their real goals (Āl, I<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span>). In this vein, the Quran advises, <i>Let not the life of this world delude you</i> (31:33; 35:5; see also 45:35). <i>Vying for increase</i> translates <i>takāthur,</i> which implies both competing and boasting. It can pertain to anything that people seek for the gratification of their egos rather than for God’s sake. According to a saying attributed to the Prophet, it means gathering wealth without right, withholding it from those to whom it rightfully belongs, and hoarding it (Q). It is reported that a Companion of the Prophet came upon him while he was reciting, <i>Vying for increase distracts you,</i> and the Prophet said, “The son of Adam says, ‘My wealth! My wealth!’ But do you get anything from your wealth except what you have eaten and finished, or what you have clothed yourself with and worn out, or what you have given as charity or spent?” (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Another <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “If the son of Adam had a valley of gold, he would wish for it to be two valleys” (IK, Q).</p>
102/002: till you visit the graves.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be interpreted according to the first occasion of revelation mentioned in the <i>sūrah</i> introduction or as implying that people will continue to be distracted and not repent before they die (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Regarding the first interpretation, <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Alī ibn Abī <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>ālib is reported to have said, “How neglectful are these visitors and how difficult is the affair. They took no lesson from something that was full of lessons, but took lessons from far-off places. Do they boast about the dead bodies of their forefathers, or do they regard the number of dead people as grounds for feeling boastful of their numbers? They want to revive bodies that have become spiritless and moments that have passed that are more appropriate as lessons than as sources of pride and that are more suitable as a source of humility than of honor” (<i>Nahj al-balāghah,</i> Sermon No. 221).</p>
102/003: Nay! Soon you will know.
102/004: Indeed! Soon you will know.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse means that people will know at the moment of death. The repetition in these verses can be viewed as emphasizing that people cannot evade the outcome of their actions (Āl, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s) and that in the Hereafter they will know the real value of the things they prized when on earth. The repetition can also be taken as a reference to the punishment realized in the grave (v. 3) and then to the punishment realized after the Final Resurrection (v. 4; Āl, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to some, the first is addressed to disbelievers and the second to believers (IK, Q). The emphatic particle <i>kallā</i> can indicate either negation or affirmation; it is thus rendered <i>Nay</i> in v. 3 and v. 5 and <i>indeed</i> in v. 4, though it could also be rendered <i>nay</i> for each or <i>indeed</i> for each (Q).</p>
102/005: Nay! If you knew with the knowledge of certainty,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses can be taken to mean that if people knew now as they will know then, <i>vying for increase</i> (v. 1) would not distract them (IK, Q), and they would turn to God at every moment (Aj) rather than to the world.</p><p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>The answer to the conditional phrase <i>if you knew</i> is dropped for rhetorical emphasis. Some say the implied answer is “then vying for increase would not distract you” (R); others say it is intentionally vague to let people wonder at the consequences and realize the gravity of their condition (R). <i>The knowledge of certainty</i> can be interpreted to mean “the knowledge of that which is certain” <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1556" title="1556"/>(Sh), meaning the Resurrection (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). It is also interpreted by many to mean <i>the truth of certainty</i> (56:95). Most Sufis see <i>the knowledge of certainty, the eye of certainty</i> (v. 7), and <i>the truth of certainty</i> as three levels of spiritual development. In this respect <i>the knowledge of certainty</i> can be likened to knowledge obtained through hearing about something, <i>the eye of certainty</i> can refer to knowledge obtained by seeing or touching something, and <i>the truth of certainty</i> can refer to sapiential knowledge obtained by tasting, or experiencing something directly. In his <i>Makkan Openings,</i> Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Arabī says that <i>the truth of certainty</i> is what is obtained through knowledge of the direct cause, <i>the eye of certainty</i> is what is provided by witnessing and spiritual unveiling, and <i>the knowledge of certainty</i> is what is provided by an indication (<i>dalīl</i>) in which there are no obscurities (<i>Futu<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>āt,</i> II 132. 27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>29). Basing his words on the famous saying “He who knows himself knows his Lord,” he further states that “one who witnesses himself witnesses his Lord and thereby moves from the certainty of knowledge to the certainty of the eye; then when he returns to his body, he returns to the certainty of truth from the certainty of the eye, not to the certainty of knowledge” (<i>Futu<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>āt,</i> III 390.1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3; cf. 2:42; 3:71).</p>
102/006: you would surely see Hellfire.
102/007: Then you would surely see it with the eye of certainty.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses can be understood as repetition for emphasis, similar to vv. 3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4; or v. 6 can be taken as an indication that people will see Hellfire before entering it and v. 7 as an indication that they will know it with certainty when they enter into it (Āl, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s).</p>
102/008: Then surely you will be questioned that Day about the blessing.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8</span><span class="hide">  </span>People will be questioned about what they have done with the blessings that God bestowed upon them while on earth (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), as in 17:36: <i>Truly hearing, and sight, and the heart—all of these will be called to account</i> (Sh). In this vein the Prophet is reported to have said to some of his Companions after they had found food for which they had left their homes in the middle of the night, “By Him in Whose Hand lies my soul, you shall be questioned about this blessing on the Day of Resurrection. Hunger brought you out of your homes, and you did not return before this blessing came to you.” Some say this verse means people will be questioned about the Prophet, since he is considered the greatest blessing sent by God (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to some this verse is addressed only to the disbelievers; according to others it is addressed to all those who are responsible for their actions (<i>al-mukallafūn</i>). When viewed as addressed only to the disbelievers, it can be seen as a reference to 67:8, where they are asked by the keepers of Hell, <i>Did not a warner come unto you?</i> It can also be seen as an indication that human beings will be asked which are the true blessings: the delights of this world or those of the Hereafter (K).</p>

103/001: By the declining day,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>For the possible meanings of <i>the declining day</i> (<i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>r</i>), see the introduction to this <i>sūrah</i>. Linguistically, <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>r</i> derives from the verb <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>ara,</i> meaning “to squeeze,” and thus relates to time that is declining or fading quickly. Among those possible meanings, many judge the most likely to be the <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>r</i> prayer (B<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>, Q, Z), which is considered to be the prayer referred to as <i>the middlemost prayer</i> in 2:238, though that verse is also interpreted in many different ways. Some also say the term in this verse refers to the “era (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>r</i>) of the Prophet because of its bounty (<i>fa<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span>l</i>) through the renewal of prophethood in it” (Q). In this vein, this <i>sūrah</i> can be seen as pertaining to both the life of the individual and that of the human species; according to traditional Islamic belief, the fall of humanity continues as the historical cycle unfolds, and each generation is a degree below the generation before it.</p>
103/002: truly mankind is in loss,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Vv. 2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3 are the response to the oath in v. 1 and are similar in meaning to 95:5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6: <i>Then We cast him to the lowest of the low, save those who believe and perform righteous deeds; for theirs shall be a reward unceasing.</i> The term <i>mankind</i> can be seen as a reference to disbelievers (Bg, Q) or to humanity in general (Q). Seen in light of the reference to <i>the declining day,</i> it can also be taken as a reference to humanity during the latter days of the historical cycle. According to 35:39, <i>the disbelief of the disbelievers increases them in naught but loss</i>. The Quranic understanding of <i>loss</i> pertains to <i>losing this world and the Hereafter</i> (22:11). The losers are thus those who lose what they value most in this life, although not necessarily purely material things, and in the next life, as in 39:15: <i>Truly the losers are those who lose their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Yea! That is the manifest loss.</i> From a spiritual perspective, <i>loss</i> can also be seen as a reference to losing faith and attachment to God. When <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>r</i> is understood as a reference to time, v. 2 indicates that people who do not use their time properly are in a constant state of loss.</p>
103/003: save those who believe, perform righteous deeds, exhort one another to truth, and exhort one another to patience.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>In this context, <i>truth</i> can mean God (Q), the Quran (Bg, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), or faith and professing Divine Unity (Bg, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s); it can also mean that at the moment of death one says to those one leaves behind, <i>and die not except in submission</i> (3:102; <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Elsewhere believers are commanded, <i>Be patient, vie in patience</i> (3:200). Exhorting to patience (cf. 90:17) can be interpreted as encouraging one another in maintaining religious practice in the face of difficulties and opposition (R). The exhortation to truth and patience can thus be seen as an exhortation paralleling that between belief in God and performing righteous deeds (Sh) and, by extension, between all that one must know (discerning truth from falsehood) and all that one must do (maintaining the practices and principles of religion, no matter the obstacles). In this sense, this verse reflects the manner in which <i>righteous deeds</i> are believed to arise from and are always conjoined with faith and belief in God. In a broader sense, the <i>sūrah</i> emphasizes the two virtues of clinging to the truth and being patient in a world that has been spiritually darkened in general and at times full of spiritual crisis for a human being in particular.</p>

104/001: Woe unto every slandering backbiter<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Woe</i> translates <i>wayl,</i> which indicates that punishment or destruction will befall them (Sh), and is taken by some as the name of a valley in Hell (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>), in which case the verse could be rendered, “[The valley of] <i>Wayl</i> is for every slandering backbiter” (see 2:79c). According to Mujāhid, <i>humazah,</i> here translated <i>slandering,</i> refers to harm done to others with one’s hands and eyes, while <i>lumazah,</i> here translated <i>backbiter,</i> refers to harm done with one’s tongue (IK). According to others, <i>humazah</i> indicates any form of calumny, while <i>lumazah</i> indicates verbal reproach and accusation (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Yet others maintain the opposite, stating that <i>lumazah</i> literally means to eat the flesh of others (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>; regarding backbiting, see 49:12). Despite the different interpretations, all point to the moral decrepitude of those who slander others whether in public or in private. It can also be taken as a more general rebuke to any who are more concerned with the faults of others than with their own (Aj).</p>
104/002: who amasses wealth and tallies it,

The punishment for those who hoard is most vividly described in 9:34<span class="HCSQ">–</span>35: <i>[As for] those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God, give them glad tidings of a painful punishment, on the Day when it will be heated in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, their sides, and their backs will be branded with it. “This is what you hoarded up for yourselves; so taste that which you hoarded.”</i></p>
104/004: Nay! He shall surely be cast into the crushing Fire.

It derives from the verb <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>a<span class="HCSQIt">ṭ</span>ama,</i> meaning “to break, shatter, smash, or crush.”</p>
104/007: which engulfs hearts.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Hearts</i> translates <i>af<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>idah,</i> which is said to indicate the very center of the heart, the subtlest faculty of the human being, which feels pain and suffering most severely (Z). This verse indicates both that the fire touches the very core of one’s being, thus consuming all that one is, and that it is more painful than any burning experienced in this world.</p>
104/008: Truly it is enclosed upon them
104/009: in pillars outstretched.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>9</span><span class="hide">  </span>These verses are taken by most as an allusion to the closing of the doors of Hell upon the disbelievers, as in 90:20: <i>Upon them is a Fire enclosed</i>. <i>Enclosed</i> translates <i>mu<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>adah,</i> which can also mean “covered.” The <i>pillars</i> are the pillars of the Fire, similar to 18:29: <i>Verily We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose canopies will encompass them</i> (Qu). V. 9 could also be translated, “as pillars outstretched.”</p>

105/001: Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the masters of the elephant?
105/002: Did He not make their scheming go astray,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Though <i>elephant</i> appears here in the singular, some say that Abrahah had eight or twelve elephants with his army (IK). According to the earliest histories, when commanded to approach Makkah, the elephant knelt and would not be moved, despite being beaten by the army. When turned in any other direction, it would rise and walk, but when turned toward Makkah, it would again kneel and refuse to move (IK; Ibn Is<span class="HCSQ">ḥ</span>āq). The linguistic structure of the verse indicates that the story was well known to the Arabs. They are thus being asked how it is that, knowing the story of how God protected the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah, they do not derive the proper lessons from it and believe in God (Sh). That God made Abrahah’s scheming go astray alludes to the manner in which God allowed them to plan the entire expedition and carry it out to their own demise, since from a Quranic perspective <i>God is the best of plotters</i> (3:54; 8:30), and <i>the scheming of the disbelievers is naught but astray</i> (40:25).</p>
105/003: and send against them birds in swarms,
105/004: pelting them with stones of baked clay,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Swarms</i> here translates <i>abābīl,</i> which is interpreted to mean “in groups,” “in successive groups,” “many,” or “coming upon them from every direction” (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). According to most authorities, God sent birds from the sea, such as swallows and herons, each carrying three stones the size of chickpeas or lentils, one in each claw and one in the beak (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). Every soldier that was hit by one was destroyed, though not all met this fate. They did not die instantly. Some are said to have lingered for many days as they tried to make their way back to Yemen (IK). According to some, <i>sijjīl,</i> here translated <i>stones of baked clay,</i> is a contraction of two Persian words, <i>sang</i> (<i>sanj</i> in Arabic), meaning “stones,” and <i>jīl,</i> meaning “clay” (IK).</p>
105/005: such that He made them like devoured husks?<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Devoured husks</i> renders <i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>āsf<sup>in</sup> ma<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>kūl,</i> which indicates the remains of leaves eaten by animals. The whole of the <i>sūrah</i> thus likens what was the greatest army known in the recent history of Arabia to one of the most insignificant of things known to the Arabs.</p>

106/001: For the secure passage of the Quraysh,
106/002: their secure passage in the journey of winter and of summer;<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Reading this verse as a continuation of the previous <i>sūrah,</i> it can be understood as an allusion to God’s saving the Quraysh from the elephant of Abrahah (see the introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 105). <i>Secure passage</i> translates <i>īlāf,</i> which comes from a root (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>-l-f</i>) indicating that one is familiar with something or resorts to it habitually. It came to be connected with <i>secure passage</i> when <i>īlāf</i> and the related word <i>ilf</i> were used as names for the grants of security that the Quraysh reportedly received from the surrounding powers: Byzantium, Persia, Abyssinia, and Yemen. In the winter the Quraysh would travel to Yemen, where they purchased spices and other commodities coming from India. Then in the summer they carried these to Syria, where they sold them and purchased agricultural products. According to some this verse is an allusion to the respect the Quraysh received as keepers of the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah, which compelled other tribes to grant them safe passage and thus contributed to their wealth (IK). In this vein, it is related to 29:67: <i>Or have they not considered that We have made a secure sanctuary while people are snatched away all around them? Do they believe in that which is false? And are they ungrateful for God’s Blessing?</i></p>
106/003: so let them worship the Lord of this house,
106/004: Who relieved them of hunger and made them safe from fear.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>This house</i> means the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah. These verses implore the Quraysh to acknowledge that it is not through anything of their own doing or through the idols they worship that they have been made safe, but through Divine Protection alone. In the overall context of the Quran, these verses allude to the fate that will befall those who reject the Prophet Muhammad. The best example of this theme is 16:112<span class="HCSQ">–</span>13: <i>God sets forth a parable: a town secure and at peace, its provision coming unto it abundantly from every side. Yet, it was ungrateful for the blessings of God; so God let it taste the garment of hunger and fear for that which they had wrought. A messenger from among themselves had surely come unto them, but they denied him. And so the punishment seized them while they were wrongdoers</i> (see also Abraham’s prayer in 2:126).</p>

107/001: Hast thou seen the one who denies religion?
107/002: That is the one who drives away the orphan,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2</span><span class="hide">  </span>There are two opinions regarding the referent of <i>the one</i>. Muqātil and al-Kalbī said, “This <i>sūrah</i> was revealed about al-<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span> ibn Wā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>il al-Sahmī” (W). Conversely, Ibn Jurayj said, “Abū Sufyān was in the habit of slaughtering two camels every week. On one occasion, an orphan came to him asking him for something. Abū Sufyān responded by hitting him with a stick. So God revealed, <i>Hast thou seen the one who denies religion? That is the one who drives away the orphan</i>” (R, W). Even if it was first recorded in reference to a specific individual, it still has a general implication. <i>Religion</i> here translates <i>dīn,</i> and denying <i>religion</i> implies denial of all aspects of the message that was sent through the Prophet. <i>Dīn</i> could also mean “judgment” and relate to the denial of the Resurrection and other events of the Afterlife. When vv. 2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>7 are viewed in relation to v. 1, the implication is that denying <i>dīn,</i> whether it be <i>religion</i> or judgment, is the root of all other sins and transgressions (R).</p><p class="indent">Cf. v. 2 with 89:17<span class="HCSQ">–</span>19. The accusation of driving away the orphan also alludes to the habit of devouring the inheritances of orphans that is addressed in 2:220; 4:2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3, 8<span class="HCSQ">–</span>10, 127; 6:152.</p>

If v. 2 can be seen as a reference to all that <i>one who denies religion</i> does in opposing the proper moral order, v. 3 can be seen as a reference to all that one does not do. This verse could also be rendered, “And does not encourage giving the food of the indigent,” implying that the food being withheld from the indigent is actually something to which the indigent have a right, for the believer is one <i>in whose wealth is an acknowledged due for the beggar and the deprived</i> (70:24<span class="HCSQ">–</span>25; cf. 51:19). On the one hand, the present verse admonishes those who do not themselves feed the indigent. On the other, it admonishes those who implore others not to do so and who are therefore not only stingy with their own money, but encourage stinginess in others. This is related to 36:47, where those who do not wish to feed the needy offer a pseudo-theological excuse for not doing so, saying, <i>Are we to feed those whom, if God willed, He would feed?</i></p>
107/004: So woe unto the praying
107/005: who are heedless of their prayers,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>For the possible meanings of <i>woe</i> (<i>wayl</i>), see 2:79c; 104:1c. These verses could be seen as a reference to the prayer of the disbelievers, about which another verse says, <i>Their prayer at the House is naught but whistling and clapping. So taste the punishment for having disbelieved!</i> (8:35). Nonetheless, the majority of commentators interpret them as a reference to those who, because of their heedlessness, receive no benefit from their prayers when they perform them and fear no retribution when they do not (Q) or to the hypocrites, who pray in public, but not in private (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). These verses can also be taken to indicate those who fail to perform their prayers at the proper time or who do not complete the required bows and prostrations (IK, Q), or interpreted as applying to those who perform all of the prayers properly, but fail to do so with humility, contemplation, and remembrance of God. A <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> states, “This is the prayer of the hypocrite. He sits watching the sun until it is between the two horns of Satan [i.e., just above the horizon]. Then he stands and pecks out four [prayer cycles] in which he remembers God but little” (IK). Regarding the implications of neglecting prayers, see 19:59c.</p>
107/006: those who strive to be seen,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Those who strive to be seen</i> are the hypocrites, of whom the Quran says, <i>When they perform the prayer, they perform it idly and to be seen of men, and they remember God but little</i> (4:142), which <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1567" title="1567"/>is to say that they do not perform prayer out of worship, but only to increase their reputation, as opposed to those <i>who are constant in their prayers</i> (70:23) and those <i>who are mindful of their prayers</i> (70:34). For the Quranic treatment of hypocrisy and dissimilitude, see 63:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>8.</p>
107/007: yet refuse small kindnesses.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">7</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is understood to indicate those who perform their devotions well but do not act kindly toward others (IK). <i>Small kindnesses</i> translates <i>mā<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ūn</i> in accord with a widespread interpretation that sees it as an allusion to utensils or tools that people would share and lend to one another, such as a pickax, a pot, a bucket, or other items of this nature (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). It can also be seen as an allusion to anything in which there is benefit (Q). Many take <i>refuse small kindnesses</i> to indicate refusal to pay the obligatory <i>zakāh</i> (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); others say that <i>mā<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ūn</i> means property (<i>māl</i>) in general in the Qurayshī dialect (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>); and others say the verse means to refuse guests. According to all of these interpretations, the verse indicates the stinginess exhibited by hypocrites, who <i>only come to the prayer lazily, and only spend reluctantly</i> (9:54).</p>

108/001: Truly We have bestowed abundant good upon thee.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Abundant good</i> translates <i>kawthar,</i> which derives from <i>kathīr,</i> meaning “much,” “abundant,” or “copious”; it is used to indicate something that is abundant in number, measure, weight, or quality, and there are at least sixteen different opinions regarding its meaning in this context (Q). The most widespread opinions regard it as a proper name referring to a river or pool in the Garden. Some Muslims will thus use the phrase “sitting by <i>Kawthar</i>” as a reference to being in Paradise. Other opinions relate <i>abundant good</i> to the gift of prophecy, the Quran (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), or various aspects of Islam, such as the daily prayers, the two testimonies (<i>shahādatayn</i>), “There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Messenger of God,” or the light within the breast that guides one to religion (Q). Some commentators take <i>abundant good</i> as a reference to the abundance of the Prophet’s progeny (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). The association with a river in Paradise finds the strongest support in the <i><span class="HCSQIt">Ḥ</span>adīth</i> literature (Q). In a widespread account, Anas ibn Mālik said, “When the Prophet was made to ascend to the heavens, he said [after his return], ‘I came upon a river the banks of which were made of tents of hollow pearls. I asked Gabriel, “What is this river?” He replied, “This is <i>Kawthar</i>” ’ ” (IK). According to another account, “<i>Kawthar</i> is a river in the Garden whose banks are of gold, and it flows over pearls and rubies. Its scent is finer than musk, and its water is sweeter than honey and whiter than milk” (IK, Q). Another account joins the river to the other gifts bestowed upon the Prophet. It is related that Abū Bishr mentioned, “Sa<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>īd ibn Jubayr said that Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās said regarding <i>Kawthar,</i> ‘That is the good that God has bestowed upon His Messenger.’ I said to Sa<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>īd ibn Jubayr, ‘But the people claim that it is a river in the Garden.’ Sa<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>īd said, ‘The river in the Garden is part of the good that God has bestowed upon His Messenger’” (IK; for references to the river or pool in the <i><span class="HCSQIt">Ḥ</span>adīth</i> literature, see the introduction to the <i>sūrah</i>). Al-<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>abarsī notes that all these sayings are particular aspects of the whole, which is the <i>abundant good</i> in the two abodes: Heaven and this world.</p>
108/002: So pray to thy Lord and sacrifice.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most interpret <i>so pray</i> as a command to perform the obligatory prayers (Q). As it is connected to the command to sacrifice, others say it indicates the prayer of the Feast of Sacrifice (<i><span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>īd al-a<span class="HCSQIt">ḍ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ā</i>), which is part of the rites of the <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ajj</i> and comes at its end (Q). In accordance with this verse and a well-known <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth,</i> most maintain that the prayer must precede the sacrifice in order for the sacrifice to be accepted (IA, Q). <i>And sacrifice</i> translates <i>wa<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>n<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ar,</i> which could also mean, “and raise your hands.” In this interpretation it is taken as a reference to the practice of raising the hands to the ears during prayer (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). All schools of law agree that this should be done at the opening of the canonical prayer while saying, “God is greatest” (<i>Allāhu akbar</i>), marking the entry into the sacred rite. According to the Mālikī and <span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>anafī schools of law, the hands should only be raised in this fashion at the opening of the prayer (IA, Q); some other schools maintain that it should be done at the opening, when bowing, and when prostrating (Q).</p>
108/003: Truly thine enemy shall be the one without posterity.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>The one without posterity</i> translates <i>abtar,</i> which can be used to refer to anything whose effects do not produce any good (Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). <i>Abtar</i> was used by Arabs to refer to one whose sons had died, but who still had daughters (Q). At the time at which this <i>sūrah</i> was most likely revealed, the Prophet had sired two sons, Qāsim and <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abd Allāh, both of whom died while toddlers. He later had a third son, Ibrāhīm, who also died as a toddler. It is reported that whenever the Prophet was mentioned in the presence of al-<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ṣ</span> ibn Wā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>il, he would say, “Leave him, for indeed he is a man who is cut off, having no descendants. So when he dies, he will not be remembered.” So God revealed this <i>sūrah</i> in response (IK, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). A less accepted <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1570" title="1570"/>account of the revelation reads <i>abtar</i> as a reference to being “cut off” from one’s tribe. According to Ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abbās, Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>b ibn Ashraf, the leader of one of the Jewish tribes of Madinah, came to Makkah and the Quraysh said to him, “You are the leader of the people. What do you think about this worthless man who is cut off (<i>abtar</i>) from his people? He claims that he is better than us, while we are the people of the sanctuary, the people of custodianship over the Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>bah, and the people who supply water to the pilgrims.” And Ka<span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>b replied, “You are better than him.” So God revealed this <i>sūrah</i> in response (IK, Q); for other verses connected to this incident, see 4:51<span class="HCSQ">–</span>52 and commentary. In either interpretation, it indicates the importance of loving the Prophet and the dire consequences of hating him as well as the idea that true posterity or legacy lies in belief and deeds, not children, for the Day of Judgment is <i>the Day when neither wealth nor children avail, save for him who comes to God with a sound heart</i> (26:88<span class="HCSQ">–</span>89).</p>

109/001: Say, “O disbelievers!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Though the circumstances of revelation indicate that <i>disbelievers</i> refers specifically to the leaders of the Quraysh (see the introduction to the <i>sūrah</i>), it can also be understood as applying to all disbelievers (IK).</p>
109/002: I worship not what you worship;
109/003: nor are you worshippers of what I worship;
109/004: nor am I a worshipper of what you worship;
109/005: nor are you worshippers of what I worship.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>5</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, the repetition in these verses is for emphasis (Q). Others say that the repetition serves to negate the repeated propositions from the leaders of the Quraysh that the Prophet mix his religion with theirs (Q; see also 39:64c). Another opinion is that the different statements refer to the present and the future, as if to say, “I do not now worship what you worship; nor are you now worshippers of what I worship; nor will I ever be a worshipper of what you worship; nor will you ever be worshippers of what I worship.” Still others say, <i>Nor am I a worshipper of what you worship</i> negates the past (Q), meaning, “Nor have I ever worshipped what you worship.”</p>
109/006: Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion.”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse is similar to 28:55, which says of the believers, <i>And when they hear idle talk, they turn away therefrom and say, “Unto us our deeds, and unto you your deeds. Peace be upon you! We do not seek out the ignorant”</i> (cf. 10:41). On the one hand, this verse is a criticism, but on the other, it implies that believers should not argue with disbelievers, but simply leave them to their own devices, for God will deal with them accordingly. Thus in 68:44<span class="HCSQ">–</span>45 God commands the believers: <i>So leave Me with those who deny this discourse. We shall lead them on little by little, whence they know not. And I shall grant them respite; truly My scheme is firm;</i> and in 86:17: <i>So be gentle with the disbelievers; grant them respite for a while.</i></p><p class="indent">According to some this verse was abrogated by the Sword Verse (Q), which commands, <i>Slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayer and give the alms, then let them go their way</i> (9:5). Others say the entire <i>sūrah</i> was abrogated. Still others say that the verse is not abrogated, because it is only a report (<i>khabar</i>), not a command (Q), and according to most scholars abrogation only applies to commands. But the two verses are not necessarily contradictory: the Sword Verse may be considered to deal with a political question, whereas this <i>sūrah</i> addresses a theological question.</p><p class="indent"><i>Religion</i> can be taken either to mean the religion of Islam with all of its rites and creeds or to imply, “You shall have the reward of your religion, and I shall have the reward of my religion” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), indicating that the end of each will not be the same. Insofar as <i>dīn,</i> here translated <i>religion,</i> can also mean “judgment,” this verse can also indicate, “You will have your judgment, and I shall have mine.”</p>

110/001: When God’s Help and Victory come<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Many commentators read this verse in the past tense, in which case <i>Victory</i> is taken as an allusion to the conquest of Makkah in 8/630 (Āl, Q, Qu, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>; which some Muslims believe was foreshadowed in Deuteronomy 33:2 and Song of Solomon 5:10). Others read it as an allusion to the Treaty of <span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>udaybiyah in 6/628 (see the introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 48; Āl). When read in the future tense, this verse is seen by many as an allusion to the conquests by which Islam spread beyond the borders of Arabia after the death of the Prophet (Āl, Q). It also has a continuous meaning, as attaining Paradise is the final victory. In this vein, al-Baqlī writes, “The <i>Victory</i> (<i>fat<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span></i>) is the opening (<i>infitā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span></i>) of the doors of arrival and the unveiling of the lights of Beauty and Majesty.”</p>
110/002: and you see mankind entering God’s religion in throngs,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some say that <i>mankind</i> indicates the Arabs in general; others say it indicates a large group from Yemen who had recently accepted Islam (Āl). When the <i>sūrah</i> is taken as a reference to the conquest of Makkah, it denotes the many tribes that had been reluctant to enter Islam as long as the Prophet’s own city remained beyond his dominion. Then when it was conquered, this final obstacle was removed and they entered Islam <i>in throngs</i>. Before the conquest, people had entered one or two at a time, sometimes a few more, but afterwards tribes from all regions of Arabia entered en masse (Sh).</p>
110/003: hymn the praise of thy Lord, and seek forgiveness from Him. Truly He is Ever Relenting.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, the meaning of <i>hymn the praise</i> in this verse is “pray” (Q). This may follow from the fact that Muslims, following the wont of the Prophet, recite various formulas of praise and glory during both the bowing and the prostrations of prayer, formulas such as “Glory be to Thee, O God, our Lord, and praise unto Thee, our Lord. O God, forgive me” (Q). In general, the verb <i>sabba<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>a,</i> translated throughout as <i>glorify</i> or <i>glorifies</i> (e.g., 57:1; 59:1; 61:1; 62:1), when combined with <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>amd</i> (“praise”) as <i>hymn the praise</i> (lit. “glorify the praise”; cf. 15:98; 20:130; 32:15; 40:7, 55; 42:5; 50:39; 52:48), indicates the recognition that God is beyond all that anyone can attribute to Him (see 57:1c). The Divine Name “the Relenting” is also coupled with the Merciful in several verses (see 2:37, 54, 128, 160; 4:16, 64; 9:104, 118; 49:12). God is portrayed as relenting unto human beings throughout human history, beginning with Adam and Eve (see 2:37c), and every revelation can be seen as a form of God’s relenting. The word for human repentance and for Divine relenting are the same in Arabic (<i>tawbah;</i> verbal form <i>tāba/yatūbu</i>). It thus represents a subtle reciprocity between Divine action and human action, as in 5:39: <i>But whosoever repents</i> (<i>tāba</i>) <i>after his wrongdoing, and makes amends, God will relent</i> (<i>yatūbu</i>) <i>unto him.</i> Though human beings can play some role in seeking their own forgiveness, ultimately it is God Who must first turn to human beings, as in 9:118: <i>Then He relented unto them, that they might repent;</i> see 2:37c and the essay “Translating the Quran.”</p>

111/001: May the hands of Abū Lahab perish, and may he perish!<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Abū Lahab was the wealthiest of the Prophet’s uncles and one of the Qurayshī leaders who most opposed the Prophet and persecuted his followers. “May [his] hands perish” is an idiomatic expression meaning, “May his power perish and all that he possesses.” Abū Lahab did not go forth to the Battle of Badr, but is reported to have died soon thereafter from a festering wound inflicted by his sister-in-law Umm al-Fa<span class="HCSQ">ḍ</span>l in retaliation for his abuse of one of her slaves who had become Muslim.</p>
111/002: His wealth avails him not, nor what he has earned.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>What he has earned,</i> or “what he has committed,” is interpreted by many to mean his children (IK, Q, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). This verse is said to be a response to Abū Lahab’s remark, “Even if what my nephew says is true, I will ransom myself . . . with my wealth and my children” (IK).</p>
111/003: He shall enter a blazing Fire.
111/004: And his wife, carrier of firewood,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3<span class="HCSQ">–</span>4</span><span class="hide">  </span>Abū Lahab’s wife, Umm Jamīl bint <span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>arb, was said to support fully his position and to have mocked the Prophet when he was ill and unable to offer supererogatory prayers, saying, “O Muhammad! I think that your satan has forsaken you” (see the introduction to <i>Sūrah</i> 93). Therefore, just as she aided him in defying God’s Messenger, part of her punishment is to aid him in Hell, carrying the firewood that will feed the flames of his punishment. As she was among the leading women of the Umayyad clan, to carry firewood would also imply that she was now doing the work of those in a lower station. In a variant reading, v. 4 can be read, “And his wife is a carrier of firewood,” or “is carrying firewood.”</p>
111/005: upon her neck is a rope of palm fiber.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>The <i>palm fiber</i> indicates a rope of palm fiber that has been put upon her neck in Hell and set aflame. This is said to be in retribution for her vow to sell a precious necklace in order to spend the proceeds on a campaign against the Prophet. Others say that it refers to an iron chain or heavy iron necklace that will be placed upon her neck in Hell.</p>

112/001: Say, “He, God, is One,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span>Some of the Companions of the Prophet are said to have read this <i>sūrah</i> without reciting <i>Say</i> (<i>qul</i>) at the beginning. While most retain it, those who omit it argue that it is not possible for the Prophet to have been unaware of God’s Oneness; thus he would not have needed to be instructed in this fashion (Āl, R). This verse can also be read, “Say, ‘He is God, One.’” Many commentators distinguish between the meaning of <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> (“One”), which is used in this verse, and <i>wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> (“One”), which is known as one of the Divine Names, as in <i>the One, the Paramount</i> (12:39; 13:16; 14:48; 38:65; 39:4; 40:16), and which some early Muslims are said to have recited in this verse rather than <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>, Z). The most widely held interpretation is that <i>wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> is a numerical one to which another number can be added, while <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> denotes an Absolute Oneness that is unique and cannot take a second or be divided (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Some view <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> and <i>wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> as synonyms (Āl, R). Others say that <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> indicates negation, as when one says <i>mā ra<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>aytu a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> (“I did not see anyone”), while <i>wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> indicates affirmation, as when one says <i>ra<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>aytu rajul wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> (“I saw one man”; R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). Both names denote oneness, but whereas <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> conveys an “internal oneness,” something that is one unto itself, <i>wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> conveys an “external oneness,” something that is one in relation to others. <i>A<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> is thus seen by many as conveying a higher degree of Divine Oneness without any consideration of its relation to the multiplicity of creation, while <i>wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i> is seen as conveying the Oneness of the Divine Being in relation to the multiplicity of Divine Attributes and of creation (K).</p><p class="indent">As Muslims meditated upon the relationship between the One God and the multiplicity of creation that God brings forth, the opening words of this <i>sūrah</i> came to be employed to identify different aspects of Divine Oneness. According to some commentators, <i>He</i> (<i>huwa</i>) designates God in and of Himself, the undifferentiated Divine Self or Essence (Kā, R). <i>Huwa</i> would thus be the greatest Name of God (<i>al-ism al-a<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span><span class="HCSQIt">ẓ</span>am;</i> <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), and one of the most effective formulas for calling upon Divine aid would be <i>yā huwa yā man lā huwa illā huwa,</i> “O He. O the One other than Whom there is no He” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s), or “O He. O the One Who is He, other than Whom there is no god” (Āl). For al-Rāzī <i>huwa</i> indicates a degree of Divinity above that designated by the Name <i>Allāh,</i> when <i>Allāh</i> is understood to indicate God in relation to the multiplicity that the Divine Essence or Self brings forth. For others, <i>huwa</i> indicates the Essence qua Essence beyond consideration of Its Attributes, and <i>Allāh</i> indicates “the Essence with the totality of the Attributes” (K). This, however, is not a difference in degree of Divinity, but in inner dimensions. According to al-Rāzī, <i>Allāh</i> can also be seen as conveying the totality of positive Divine Attributes (e.g., Creator, Knower, Powerful), and <i>a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> can be seen as conveying the totality of negative Divine Attributes (e.g., without body, substance, or accident); the two together, <i>Allāh a<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>ad</i> (“God, One”), thus communicate the complete understanding of God. In this context, the Name <i>Allāh</i> is sometimes referred to as the “Gathering Name” (<i>al-ism al-jāmi<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span></i>), because all of the other Divine Names and Attributes are in principle gathered within it.</p>
112/002: God, the Eternally Sufficient unto Himself.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Eternally Sufficient unto Himself</i> translates the Divine Name <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">Ṣ</span>amad,</i> which occurs in the Quran only this once and is applied only to God. Its lexical, nontheological meaning indicates something solid and impenetrable or simply “not hollow” (A<span class="HCSQ">Ḥ</span>, Q, R, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>). In this regard, some take <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">Ṣ</span>amad</i> to indicate something that is beyond all comprehension (My). Theologically <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">Ṣ</span>amad</i> is interpreted by some as an allusion to the Primary or Initial Cause of all things, an eternally self-sufficient independent Being Who continues <span class="right_1" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_1580" title="1580"/>to exist after His creation has ceased to exist, “the One Who has always been and will always be” (<span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). According to al-Zamakhsharī, in this context, “<i>Al-<span class="HCSQIt">Ṣ</span>amad</i> is a verb taking the meaning of the passive participle, the One to Whom one betakes oneself (<i>man <span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>umida ilayhi</i>) when one seeks Him (<i>idhā qa<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>adahu</i>). And He is the Master Who is Sought (<i>al-sayyid al-ma<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>mūd</i>) in [all] needs. The meaning then is, ‘He is God of Whom you are aware and Whom you affirm as the Creator of the heavens and of the earth, and as your Creator. And He is the One (<i>al-Wā<span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>id</i>) unified in Divinity, in which none shares. And He is the One Whom all that is created seeks (<i>ya<span class="HCSQIt">ṣ</span>amadu</i>); none are independent of Him, though He is independent of them.’” The enigmatic nature of <i>al-<span class="HCSQIt">Ṣ</span>amad</i> has led to many interpretations, most of which are different formulations confirming that God is the Master and ontological Source of all things and that all things are dependent upon Him, while He is independent of all things.</p>
112/003: He begets not; nor was He begotten.<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse was read by some as two verses (Āl, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>s). It denies categorically any form of Divine progeny and is thus seen by the vast majority of Muslims as repudiating any and all such claims. Although this verse is interpreted as denying that Jesus is the “Son of God” (see 4:171; 9:30; 19:35, 91<span class="HCSQ">–</span>92), it should be noted that the Christian notion of sonship is not the same as that held by the pagan Arabs, who are criticized in other verses for ascribing offspring to God (usually daughters), as in 16:57: <i>And they assign unto God daughters</i> (see also 6:100; 43:16). Attempts to link this verse to discussions of Christianity are thus somewhat tenuous, and it is best understood in relation to the possible occasions of revelation mentioned in the <i>sūrah</i> introduction and to the Quranic critique of the pagan Arab notions of Divine procreation, as in 37:149<span class="HCSQ">–</span>53: <i>So ask them, does your Lord have daughters while they have sons? Or did We create the angels female, while they were witnesses? Behold! It is of their own perversion that they say, “God has begotten,” while truly they are liars. Has He chosen daughters over sons?</i> (see also 39:2<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3; 52:39). Such notions are distinct from the Christian understanding of Divine sonship in that the meaning of “son” in the phrase “Son of God” employed in the Christian creed is very different from the meaning of “son” in the Quran. For Christianity, the term “Son of God” refers to Jesus as the pretemporal, uncreated Word of God that is begotten of the Father before time. For the pagan Arabs, however, the progeny of God had a distinctly temporal and physical connotation; see 4:171c.</p>
112/004: And none is like unto Him.”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse underscores the previous verses by emphasizing that God is not only One, but also unique. As created things can be described by attributes such as living, seeing, and hearing, by which God is also described, the meaning here is that nothing bears any likeness or equality with God’s Essence or Self (Aj, Sh), as in 42:11: <i>Naught is like unto Him</i>. Nonetheless, nothing can exist independently of God. With regard to the Divine Essence, God is absolutely transcendent, for <i>all things perish, save His Face</i> (28:88). Yet with regard to the manner in which God manifests in the world (see 57:4c), He is immanent, for <i>wheresoever you turn, there is the Face of God</i> (2:115); for the manner in which God is both near and far, similar and dissimilar, or transcendent and immanent, see 2:115c; 24:35c; 41:53c; 50:16c. According to Mujāhid, this verse means that God does not have a spouse (IK), as in 6:100<span class="HCSQ">–</span>101: <i>They make the jinn partners with God, though He created them, and falsely attribute sons and daughters to Him, without any knowledge. . . . How should He have a child when He has no consort, and He created all things?</i> (see also 16:57; 43:16). It is also taken as a refutation of the pre-Islamic Arabs, who had ascribed jinn as partners to God, as in 37:158: <i>They have made kinship between Him and the jinn—yet the jinn know that they will surely be arraigned.</i></p>

113/001: Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Daybreak</i> translates <i>falaq,</i> which indicates “the light of dawn” or “the rising dawn” (Sh). The root verb <i>falaqa</i> means “to cleave.” In this context it indicates the manner in which the night appears to be cleaved from the day (Sh). Hence God is described as the <i>Cleaver of the dawn</i> in 6:96. <i>Falaq</i> can also be used metaphorically to indicate “the emergence of truth after uncertainty” (<i>Tāj al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>arūs</i>). Hence this verse can be read as indicating that God is the source of all true understanding, such that to seek refuge in Him is to seek refuge in truth from falsehood, as in 17:81: <i>Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished. Truly falsehood is ever vanishing.</i> For a discussion of the Quranic symbolism of light, see 24:35c. <i>Falaq</i> is also taken by some as a name of Hell, a prison in Hell, or one of the trees or mountains in the Fire (Q, Sh, <span class="HCSQ">Ṭ</span>).</p>
113/002: from the evil of what He has created,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">2</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse can be understood as a reference to Satan and his ilk or to Hellfire; it may also be a general reference to all that is evil (Q) or to all the evil that is committed or manifested by those whom God has created (Z). It can also be understood as a reference to creation itself, which acts as a veil that both hides the Creator and reveals His Qualities and Attributes.</p>
113/003: from the evil of darkness when it enshrouds,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">3</span><span class="hide">  </span>Most interpret this verse as a reference to the darkening of the night, but some take the verb <i>waqaba,</i> here translated <i>enshrouds,</i> as a reference to the cooling of the night (Q). In both interpretations, refuge is sought because it is the time when those inclined to evil spread mischief and corruption, as in 4:81 and 4:108, which speak of those who <i>conspire by night</i> (Q). In the present verse, <i>darkness</i> translates <i>ghāsiq,</i> which is also interpreted as a reference to the moon, based upon a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> in which the Prophet looked to the moon and said to his wife, “O <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Ā<span class="HCSQ">ʾ</span>ishah, seek refuge in God from this, for this is <i>al-ghāsiq</i> when it sets (<i>waqaba</i>)” (Q). A minority say that the verse refers to “the Pleiades when it sets,” because of the disease and pestilence believed to become prevalent during the period when this luminous star cluster declines (Q).</p>
113/004: from the evil of those who blow upon knots,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span><i>Those who blow upon knots</i> (<i>naffathāt</i>) refers specifically to those engaged in the practice of tying knots in a string and whispering incantations over them (see the introduction to the <i>sūrah</i>), but can also be taken to indicate all those who engage in black magic. Though the noun is in the feminine plural, it is not necessarily limited to women, but may indicate human beings in general (R, Z). In this sense it could be understood as a reference to general evil as practiced in this specific case by the women who blow on knots.</p>
113/005: and from the evil of the envier when he envies.”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>According to some, the refuge sought in this verse is freedom from the effects of envy. In this vein, the Umayyad Caliph <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Umar ibn <span class="HCSQ">ʿ</span>Abd al-Azīz (r. 717<span class="HCSQ">–</span>20) is reported to have said, “I cannot think of any wrongdoer more likely to be wronged than one who envies another” (Z). From one perspective, envy is the root of all evils, as the first sin to be committed in the celestial realm was Satan’s envy of Adam (see 2:34<span class="HCSQ">–</span>36; 7:11<span class="HCSQ">–</span>13) and the first sin to be committed on earth was Cain’s envy of Abel (see 5:27<span class="HCSQ">–</span>31; Q). It is thus said that those who envy the favor bestowed upon others oppose the blessings of God (Q).</p>

114/001: Say, “I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind,
114/002: the King of mankind,
114/003: the God of mankind,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>3</span><span class="hide">  </span>These three verses are seen as an indication that, in order to find true refuge from Satan, people must recognize the complete sovereignty of God, that He is the only One to be worshipped and the only One upon Whom they can call for help, unlike those who take others <i>as lords apart from God</i> (9:31; Sh). From a Quranic perspective, it is by forgetting that God is the Lord, King or Sovereign, and <i>God of mankind</i> that human beings arrogate self-sufficiency to themselves, as when Pharaoh declares, <i>I am your lord most high</i> (79:24), <i>Is not the sovereignty of Egypt mine</i> (43:51), and <i>I know of no god for you other than myself</i> (28:38). Thus it is as if human beings are here being ordered to seek refuge from the illusion of self-sufficiency that is the root of all sin through acknowledging their complete dependence on God by saying, “Oh my Lord! Oh my King! Oh my God!” (R).</p>
114/004: from the evil of the stealthy whisperer,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">4</span><span class="hide">  </span>Satan is here described as <i>the stealthy whisperer</i> because he withdraws from the heart whenever one remembers God and whispers to it whenever one is heedless of God (Bg, R, Sh). Technically whispering (<i>waswasah</i>) refers to something said quietly and repeatedly. Here it is taken to indicate all manner of temptation. The first sin of Adam and Eve was to listen to the whispers of Satan (7:20). Elsewhere Satan is described as <i>the Deluder</i> (31:33; 35:5); he seduces (47:25), causes people to forget (6:68; 12:42; 18:63; 58:19) or to slip (3:155), makes what is evil seem fair (6:43; 8:48; 16:63; 27:24; 29:38), desires to lead astray (4:60), and incites to evil (12:100). He is thus described in many verses as <i>a manifest enemy</i> (e.g., 2:168, 208; 6:142; 7:22; 12:5; 17:53).</p>
114/005: who whispers into the breasts of mankind,<p class="indent"><span class="red1">5</span><span class="hide">  </span>Here it is Satan <i>who whispers into the breasts of mankind,</i> but elsewhere it is the soul that is described as whispering (50:16), prompting to evil (5:30; 20:96), and seducing (12:18). However, the reference here is not to the soul as such, but to the passionate soul, or <i>the soul</i> that <i>commands to evil</i> (<i>al-nafs al-<span class="HCSQIt">ʿ</span>ammārah bi-l-su<span class="HCSQIt">ʾ</span>;</i> 12:53), regarding which a famous <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> says, “Truly Satan flows in the blood of the son of Adam” (Q). From one perspective, it is Satan who suggests, tempts, prompts, and whispers, and the passionate soul then follows the caprices that arise rather than the commands of God. From another perspective, only <i>the soul</i> that <i>commands to evil</i> has this propensity. In this vein, 43:36 says, <i>And whosoever turns blindly away from the remembrance of the Compassionate, We assign to him a satan who is then a companion unto him</i> (see also 7:27); regarding <i>the soul</i> that <i>commands to evil,</i> see 12:53c; 75:1<span class="HCSQ">–</span>2c; 89:27c.</p>
114/006: from jinn and mankind.”<p class="indent"><span class="red1">6</span><span class="hide">  </span>This verse refers to what whispers into the souls of <i>jinn and mankind,</i> or to the jinn who whisper into the souls of people and to people who heed the advice of their own whispering soul rather than the Guidance of God and thus fail to take God as their Lord, King, and God. It can also be seen as a reference to both the jinn and people who whisper into souls (Q, R), since there are said to be <i>satans from among mankind and jinn</i> (6:112). It may also indicate what whispers into the “breasts” of both the <i>jinn and mankind,</i> for although <i>nās</i> (here translated <i>mankind</i>) is usually taken as a reference to human beings, there is a <i><span class="HCSQIt">ḥ</span>adīth</i> stating that there was a “people” (<i>nās</i>) among the jinn, in the same way that the word <i>rijāl,</i> which usually designates human men, is also used in reference to <i>individuals</i> (<i>rijāl</i>) <i>among the jinn</i> in 72:6 (R, Sh). Vv. 5<span class="HCSQ">–</span>6 also have the meaning of seeking refuge from the one <i>who whispers into the breasts of mankind</i> and seeking refuge from the <i>jinn</i> and from <i>mankind</i> (Sh).</p>
